			<p data-aid="126617362" id="p2">I was never involved in any fights in high school. I’m glad I wasn’t. I’m not very big, and I don’t find great joy in cuts and bruises.</p>
			<p data-aid="126617363" id="p3">But one time I got into a fight walking home from school that lasted a few weeks. My opponent was only 28 centimeters tall, but this was one of the toughest battles I’d ever fought. This battle was with a magazine.</p>
			<p data-aid="126617364" id="p4">My high school was within view of our front porch, so I walked to and from class every day. One afternoon, as I stepped across the thin ribbon of green lawn that divided the school’s sidewalk from the road, I noticed an open magazine by the curb. I couldn’t tell what it was at first; then I realized it was pornographic. I quickly lifted my eyes from the gutter and kept walking toward home.</p>
			<p data-aid="126617365" id="p5">This is how the battle began. Every day as I went to school, and every day as I came home, I had to face the temptation that lay in the gutter.</p>
			<p data-aid="126617366" id="p6">As I think about it now, I wonder why I didn’t just pick up the magazine and throw it away. But I didn’t even want to touch it. What if someone saw me with it? Or what if my dad saw it in our garbage can? Or what if I picked it up and saw more than I wanted to see?</p>
			<p data-aid="126617367" id="p7">Each day my mind could come up with some pretty good rationalizations: “It might be good for you to know what’s in there, so you’ll know what’s going on in today’s world,” or “You don’t want to be a sheltered, naive little boy, do you? What’s it going to hurt, anyway? Just repent later. Who’s going to know?”</p>
			<p data-aid="126617368" id="p8">One day in seminary, our teacher pointed out that Jesus answered each of his temptations with a scripture. That sounded like a good idea.</p>
			<p data-aid="126617369" id="p9">Looking through my scriptures, I found a verse about battling temptation: “Humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/bofm/alma/13.html?verse=28#p28">Alma 13:28</a>).</p>
			<p data-aid="126617370" id="p10">Another helpful verse came from the New Testament: “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.html?verse=13#p13">1 Cor. 10:13</a>).</p>
			<p data-aid="126617371" id="p11">This was a formula I could use: humble myself, watch and pray continually, and trust that God would help me find a way to escape the temptation. I began to cross the street in a different place, and these two verses of scripture helped me as the days passed with the magazine still sitting there in the gutter.</p>
			<p data-aid="126617372" id="p12">One afternoon, as I stepped off the curb, I noticed that the magazine was gone. I could tell by the appearance of the gutters that a street cleaner had recently passed by. A street cleaner—how appropriate, I thought.</p>
			<p data-aid="126617373" id="p13">God <em>did </em>make a way for me to escape, and together we won the fight. Curiosity, rationalization, and laziness are no match against courage, self-control, and mental toughness.</p>
			<p data-aid="126617374" id="p14">Victory in physical battles requires strength, muscles, and skill; but the fight is never tougher and the victory is never sweeter than in the battles with temptation. No, I never got into any fights in high school; but with some help from the scriptures, I defeated a 28-centimeter magazine.</p>
