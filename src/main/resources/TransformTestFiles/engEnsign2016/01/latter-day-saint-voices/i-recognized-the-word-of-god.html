			<p data-aid="127846697" id="p3">While in an airport several years ago in São Paulo, Brazil, I saw in a bookstore showcase a book titled “The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.” I doubted that our decaying and directionless world would accept another testament of Jesus Christ, and I spent the weekend thinking about the book.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846699" id="p4">Finally, I could no longer endure my curiosity, and I returned to the bookstore to buy it. When I arrived, however, I couldn’t find it. I described the book to the store attendant, but he said he had never seen it. Nor could he find a record of it, even though all books displayed in the showcase were cataloged.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846702" id="p5">Sometime later while in a pharmacy, I noticed an open book on a counter. As I began to read it, I learned about a man named Korihor who insisted on doubting the power of God and was eventually struck dumb. When I reflected on the words I read, I recognized them as being from God.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846704" id="p6">During this time I had been looking for divine direction. One day I knelt and fervently prayed asking God to show me the true path that would bring me to Him. A few days later our son became ill, so I returned to the pharmacy. When I was about to leave, three young Americans wearing name tags entered. I immediately felt a warmth in my breast, which prompted me to speak with them.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846707" id="p7">They told me they were in Brazil to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I asked if they could teach me, and we scheduled an appointment.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846708" id="p8">When I heard about the Prophet Joseph Smith for the first time, I knew my prayer had been answered. Then the missionaries gave me a book. To my astonishment, it was a Book of Mormon—just like the one I had seen in the showcase. I again felt a sweet warmth and became so happy that I was barely able to speak.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846709" id="p9">The missionaries explained the origin of the book and then asked me to pray and ask God if it was true. I already had an absolute certainty of the divinity of the book, for the Lord had shown it to me—twice. Nevertheless, I examined it in great detail. Upon reading <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.html">chapter 17 in 3 Nephi</a>, I knew it contained a divine story because it contained the words of Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846710" id="p10">The foundation of my testimony is in knowing that the Book of Mormon contains the word of God. It has changed me and continues to change me.</p>
