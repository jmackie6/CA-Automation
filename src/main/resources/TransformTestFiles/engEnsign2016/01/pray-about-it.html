			<p data-aid="127846810" id="p3">I told the bishop he had the wrong person.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846811" id="p4">“I do not like other people’s children, I’ve never taught children, and I can’t sing,” I said.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846812" id="p5">“Sister Taylor,” he replied, “the Lord qualifies whomever He calls. You’ll be great.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127846813" id="p6">He asked me to think about the calling and let him know the next Sunday whether I would accept it.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846814" id="p7">“I’m trying to raise a six-year-old, a three-year-old, and a baby,” I said. “I can barely make it through the day with my own children, and now you want to put me with 40 more and have me teach them music?”</p>
			<p data-aid="127846815" id="p8">He responded, “Pray about it.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127846816" id="p9">That afternoon I tried to explain to my husband, Mark, why the calling was a bad idea. How could I work in Primary when I couldn’t even be the kind of mother to my own children I wanted to be? A fear had been plaguing me for months that I was failing as a mother.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846817" id="p10">The week went by in a blur, but my thoughts kept turning to the bishop’s parting words. Finally, Sunday morning in my bedroom, I fell to my knees in prayer. Tears started down my face, but a sweet peace filled my heart. Immediately I knew it was right to accept the calling. As I submitted to the Lord’s will, all the angst fled my heart.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846818" id="p11">When I entered the Primary room after sacrament meeting, the Primary president introduced me, and the children sang a welcome song. Looking into their hopeful eyes and seeing my six-year-old son beam, I resolved to be the best Primary chorister I could be.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846819" id="p12">From then on I spent a lot of time learning songs and preparing lessons. I played the Primary songs at home, in the car, and on walks. I researched different teaching methods and devoted hours each week to making posters and developing games.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846820" id="p13">As I prepared a lesson for singing time one afternoon at the kitchen table, I was humming the song “Scripture Power.” My six-year-old was sitting at the counter eating a sandwich, and my three-year-old was cutting pieces of paper next to me. As I hummed the chorus, suddenly both children burst out:</p>

			<p data-aid="127846825" id="p18">That’s when I knew that the calling was an answer to my prayers. I had been asking the Lord to show me how to be a better mother, and He gave me a calling that would teach me how as I taught music to my children.</p>
			<p data-aid="127846826" id="p19">I am so grateful for my bishop’s inspiration and his loving words: “Pray about it.”</p>
