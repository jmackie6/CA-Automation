Consider using a set of dominoes or gathering items from around your home to use as dominoes. Have family members set them up in a line and then push the first one over. Discuss how the Book of Mormon is central to the message of the Church and how it is like the first domino: once we know for ourselves that the Book of Mormon is true, all of the other truths of the Restoration fall into place, just like the other dominoes. You might want to share one of the stories from the article and then invite family members to share their testimonies of the Book of Mormon.</p>

You might use the idea for January’s youth topic, the Godhead, in a family home evening. You could also review as a family the learning methods described in the article and discuss which ones have been particularly helpful for your family. You might invite family members to use these methods to prepare future family home evening lessons based on the gospel topics in this article.</p>

				</header>
				<p data-aid="127844565" id="aside1_p1">One of the most memorable family home evenings from my teenage years was the time we wrote special notes for each other. The name of each family member was written on a separate piece of paper. As these papers were passed from person to person, we wrote what we loved most about the family member whose name was at the top of the paper. I kept mine. A few years later during my mission, I reread it, and it was a great blessing of comfort for me to know of the love my siblings and parents had for me.</p>
