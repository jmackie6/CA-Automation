			<p data-aid="127849351" id="p3">I stood in line at a gas station. In front of me, a mother with two small children asked for $3 worth of gas and two vanilla ice-cream cones.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849352" id="p4">At first glance I could see that they had very little. The children were barefoot and wearing tattered clothing.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849353" id="p5">I heard the woman place what seemed to be an infinite number of coins on the counter to pay her bill.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849354" id="p6">After paying for my gas, I walked out and glanced at the mother’s car. It was an older model that likely got very poor gas mileage.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849355" id="p7">I felt a twinge of sympathy for this mother of two, but I started my motorcycle and went on with my day.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849356" id="p8">Less than a minute into my ride on the highway, a voice came to me: “Go help her.” The prompting came twice.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849357" id="p9">I shook my head, thinking that she had probably already left. What would I say to her anyway?</p>
			<p data-aid="127849358" id="p10">The voice came clearly a third time: “Go help her!”</p>
			<p data-aid="127849359" id="p11">I turned back toward the service station, trying to figure out what I was going to say if she was still there.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849360" id="p12">Upon arriving, I saw that her car doors were open. She was in the driver’s seat, and her two small children were enjoying their ice cream in the backseat.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849361" id="p13">I offered a small prayer, asking Heavenly Father what I should say. The same voice said to me, “Introduce yourself and ask if she needs help.” I approached her car and introduced myself. I shared with her that I felt impressed to ask her if she needed help.</p>
			<p data-aid="127849362" id="p14">She began to cry and said, “I just finished praying to Jesus, asking Him to send someone to help me.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127849363" id="p15">Heavenly Father had answered her prayer. I paid to fill up her tank with gas and gave her the phone number of someone in our elders quorum who was hiring at the time. I do not know what happened with this young mother afterward, but I am grateful I followed the prompting to help her.</p>
