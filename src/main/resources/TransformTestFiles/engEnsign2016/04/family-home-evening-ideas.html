			<p data-aid="127850062" id="p1"><strong><a class="cross-ref" href="../../../ensign/2016/04/young-adults/recognizing-satans-counterfeits.html">“Recognizing Satan’s Counterfeits,”</a></strong> page 12: Consider reading together the first two paragraphs of the article. The author was able to identify the counterfeit money by comparing it to the real thing and focusing on the differences. Show a real dollar and a piece of play money, and ask your family which is genuine. Ask them how they knew which money was real and talk about some of the differences between the two bills. Brainstorm some of the counterfeits Satan tries to put in our lives and discuss how to avoid being fooled by them (see pages 13–14 for some ideas).</p>
			<p data-aid="127850063" id="p2"><strong><a class="cross-ref" href="../../../ensign/2016/04/watchmen-on-the-tower.html">“Watchmen on the Tower,”</a></strong> page 28: Have your family assemble a simple puzzle together. Show only one family member the puzzle’s box with the picture of the completed puzzle. Explain that this person will represent the prophet. As the family puts together the puzzle, allow the “prophet” to give instructions and describe what the puzzle should look like. Point out that a prophet, like a watchman on a tower, can see things the rest of us cannot see. Read together page 29 to discover other ways that prophets are like watchmen. Consider making a list of warnings our modern prophets have given us.</p>
