			<p data-aid="129952111" id="p3">As I was being introduced as a speaker recently, the person conducting politely mentioned some of my more prominent past Church callings, such as bishop, mission president, and member of a stake presidency. This brother was being gracious, but the thought occurred to me, why not introduce me as a ward mission leader (my current calling) or by some of my less-public callings?</p>
			<p data-aid="129952112" id="p4">I can honestly say that I felt the same guiding spirit in each calling, and each has been rewarding. I have always sought the Lord’s guidance in my callings, and never have I felt let down. I have concluded that the Lord delights to bless us—regardless of where we serve.</p>
			<p data-aid="129952113" id="p5">I believe we will receive “a crown of immortality, and eternal life” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/81.html?verse=6#p6">D&amp;C 81:6</a>) not because of prominent callings but rather because we have humbly served in whatever callings we have received. The Savior has said:</p>
			<p data-aid="129952114" id="p6">“Let not the head say unto the feet it hath no need of the feet; for without the feet how shall the body be able to stand?</p>
			<p data-aid="129952115" id="p7">“Also the body hath need of every member, that all may be edified together, that the system may be kept perfect” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.html?verse=109-110#p109">D&amp;C 84:109–10</a>).</p>
			<p data-aid="129952116" id="p8">I have feared some Church callings during my life. Whenever I had such thoughts about a potential calling, it was a sure bet I would soon receive it. To accept such callings has required faith and reliance on promises found in the scriptures.</p>
			<p data-aid="129952117" id="p9">Nephi said, “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.html?verse=7#p7">1 Nephi 3:7</a>). Paul declared, “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.html?verse=7#p7">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).</p>
			<p data-aid="129952118" id="p10">At times we may feel that it’s our right to refuse a calling if we fear it. But we need to remember that Church leaders pray about callings and the individuals who are to receive them.</p>
			<p data-aid="129952119" id="p11">When we refuse a calling, the position passes to another, who will have the opportunity to grow and be blessed for serving (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.html?verse=32#p32">D&amp;C 58:32</a>).</p>
			<p data-aid="129952120" id="p12">The Lord delights to bless us, and I have found that no matter how much I serve, I continue to be in His debt. Truly, He has blessed my family and me beyond my wildest dreams for our service in His kingdom.</p>
