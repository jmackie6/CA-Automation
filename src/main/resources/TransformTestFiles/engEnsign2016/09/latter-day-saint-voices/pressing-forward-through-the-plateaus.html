			<p data-aid="129953200" id="p3">Outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, and skiing are a big part of my life. Recently, it struck me how similar our time on earth is to the time I dedicate to outdoor fitness. I tend to focus on building my stamina and skills in one activity for a time or season. Then by choice, chance, or invitation, I switch to another. No matter how fit and confident I feel in a type of fitness, though, upon switching to a new enterprise, I find myself winded, falling short, and feeling muscles I’ve “never felt before.” Then I settle into the new type of fitness and rebuild the necessary endurance and skills.</p>
			<p data-aid="129953201" id="p4">Similarly, in life we tend to become focused on certain habits. We become comfortable. Then by choice, chance, or invitation, our plateau of comfort and ease becomes a period of challenge and opportunity for growth.</p>
			<p data-aid="129953202" id="p5">Tackling life’s challenges can be a daunting task. Nephi encourages us, saying, “Press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.html?verse=20#p20">2 Nephi 31:20</a>).</p>
			<p data-aid="129953203" id="p6">Occasionally, I wonder how nice it might have been to have remained indefinitely in the premortal existence, listening to Heavenly Father simply <em>tell</em> us about His great plan of happiness. However, our progression required a “classroom”—earth—where we could experience mortality for ourselves.</p>
			<p data-aid="129953204" id="p7">Over the years as I have testified of the truthfulness and need for Heavenly Father’s plan, new opportunities and sometimes-painful experiences have embedded this teaching into my soul. We seem to learn gospel truths in layers, revisiting the same subjects again and again. I sometimes find myself asking, “How much deeper are we going to go here?” Or, like fitness, “How many other muscle groups do I still need to train?”</p>
			<p data-aid="129953205" id="p8">Still, as the seasons of life change and challenges vary, I know that the Lord will provide me with the experiences I need. And as I press forward, I will learn to become more like Him and return to His presence.</p>
