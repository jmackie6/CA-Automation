			<p data-aid="129953336" id="p3">The Primary “Family Day” had been a wonderful success and was made even better when our son Ben, a recently returned missionary, came home from the university just for the occasion. We played softball, cricket, hide-and-seek, and Frisbee, and enjoyed the swings and playground equipment. We were one of the last families to leave.</p>
			<p data-aid="129953338" id="p4">As we began packing up all our things, Ben discovered his keys had fallen from his pocket. A frantic search ensued. During the activities of the day, he had been running around with his siblings and other children over many acres of the park; finding his keys seemed an absolutely hopeless task.</p>
			<p data-aid="129953340" id="p5">The older children raced towards the playground equipment to search. I followed, hand-in-hand with our five-year-old son, Mitchell. I suggested to him that we should have a prayer and ask Heavenly Father to help us find Ben’s keys. So in the middle of a playing field, Mitchell and I had a quiet prayer together telling Heavenly Father how much Ben needed to find his keys and how difficult the task would be without His help. After the prayer I asked Mitchell whether he thought Heavenly Father would answer our prayers. He replied confidently, “Oh, yeah!”</p>
			<p data-aid="129953343" id="p6">As I looked across the vast fields we had covered during the day, common sense told me it wasn’t going to happen. I secretly feared for the faith of this five-year-old child. But time has never dimmed the significance of what happened next. We literally took one pace and there the keys were. I was overwhelmed with emotion. My young son had taught me a valuable lesson that day about faith in Heavenly Father, who I know answers our prayers.</p>
