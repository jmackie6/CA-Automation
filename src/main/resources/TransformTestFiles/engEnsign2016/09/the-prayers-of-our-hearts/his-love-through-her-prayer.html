			<p data-aid="129953339" id="p3">My Relief Society president asked if she might begin our visiting teaching interview with prayer. I expected her to ask for the presence of the Spirit as we discussed the needs of the sisters I visited. This she did, but then she proceeded to pray earnestly and specifically for me in the challenges I was facing—some of which she knew, others that she didn’t.</p>
			<p data-aid="129953341" id="p4">I cannot express the comfort and joy that filled my soul as I heard her pray for me. Outside my own family, I had never before heard someone pray for me in this way. I truly felt that my Relief Society president was inspired to convey the love and blessings of the Lord to me.</p>
			<p data-aid="129953342" id="p5">After I collected myself, we discussed the sisters for whom I had responsibility, and my leader compassionately encouraged me in my efforts to support one particular sister who was also experiencing difficulties.</p>
			<p data-aid="129953344" id="p6">I left this far-from-ordinary interview with a renewed hope for my own situation and a heightened sense of the importance of caring for others. While my family has always prayed for those we know are in need, now I do it more frequently and specifically in my individual prayers as well. I know from personal experience that “the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man [or woman] availeth much” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/nt/james/5.html?verse=16#p16">James 5:16</a>).</p>
