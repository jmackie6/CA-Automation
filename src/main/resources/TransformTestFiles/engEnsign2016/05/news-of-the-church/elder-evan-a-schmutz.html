			<p data-aid="127852207" id="p1">Elder Evan Antone Schmutz is grateful for the revelatory experiences entrusted to him by the Lord. His conversion to the gospel has been deepened through regular scripture study, service in the kingdom, and obedience to his commitments to God.</p>
			<p data-aid="127852208" id="p2">Born on June 6, 1954, in St. George, Utah, USA, to Richard and Miriam Schmutz, Elder Schmutz learned early about the power of prayer. As a Cub Scout he sold U.S. $17 worth of tickets to a jamboree but couldn’t find the money when it was time to turn it in. His mother encouraged him to pray, and the Lord revealed to him exactly where the money was. It was a strong confirmation of God’s love for and awareness of him.</p>
			<p data-aid="127852209" id="p3">At 18, Elder Schmutz lost his older sister to an auto accident. It had a tremendous impact on him, bringing about significant spiritual experiences.</p>
			<p data-aid="127852210" id="p4">Shortly thereafter he was called on a mission and reported for training. He prayed for a personal witness of the gospel. While observing some instructors teaching about the First Vision, he says, “I received a testimony so powerful that I could hardly stay in the room.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127852211" id="p5">After serving in the North Carolina Greensboro Mission, Elder Schmutz made a point of continuing to study the scriptures every day for the rest of his life. “I have found great joy, personal learning, and understanding through early morning study for a long, long time.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127852213" id="p6">Elder Schmutz married Cindy Lee Sims on February 3, 1978, in the Provo Utah Temple. Elder Schmutz earned a degree in English and a juris doctorate from Brigham Young University. He worked professionally for several law firms from 1984 to 2016.</p>
			<p data-aid="127852214" id="p7">While managing the demands of five children, Elder Schmutz served as a high councilor, bishop, member of a stake presidency, president of the Philippines Cebu Mission (2011–14), missionary training center branch president, and as a member of the Fifth Quorum of Seventy.</p>
