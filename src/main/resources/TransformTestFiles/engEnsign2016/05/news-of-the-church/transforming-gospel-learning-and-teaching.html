			<p data-aid="127852355" id="p1">Learning, living, and teaching the gospel are critical to our personal growth and are essential parts of our Sabbath day worship. As part of the ongoing effort to help members grow as they build faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and improve Sabbath worship, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles introduced during general conference leadership meetings a new effort to improve teaching and learning the gospel. Members are invited to:</p>
			<p data-aid="127852357" id="p2">1. Adopt the principles in <em>Teaching in the Savior’s Way.</em> This new manual focuses on the simple but powerful principles the Master Teacher used. The goal for every teacher, as stated in the manual, is “to teach the pure doctrine of the gospel, by the Spirit, in order to help God’s children build their faith in the Savior and become more like Him.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127852360" id="p3">Although the manual is intended for those with a calling to teach, anyone will find it useful in learning to teach the way the Savior taught. Parents can benefit from applying the principles within the booklet when teaching at home.</p>
			<p data-aid="127852361" id="p4">2. Participate in teacher council meetings. Teacher council meetings are not the same as previous teacher improvement courses. As councils, these meetings will provide opportunities for teachers to discuss together and learn from each other the principles of <em>Teaching in the Savior’s Way.</em> These meetings, to be held once a month during the Sunday block of meetings, will be rolled out worldwide throughout 2016.</p>
			<p data-aid="127852363" id="p5">3. Be diligent gospel learners. Members and teachers alike are encouraged to be diligent gospel learners at home. Learning and living the gospel during the week prepares members to participate in Sunday lessons, which can create more meaningful learning experiences for everyone.</p>
			<p data-aid="127852365" id="p6">As children of our Heavenly Father, we all have the potential to become like Him. Anyone willing to learn and live the gospel can become more like our heavenly parents and return to live with them. Worship at church and in the home helps us build that kind of faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.</p>
