			<p data-aid="130049681" id="p1">President Thomas S. Monson once told about a time when he learned the importance of obedience. When he was eight years old, his family visited their cabin in the mountains. He and his friend wanted to clear a grassy spot for a campfire. They tried to clear the grass by hand, tugging and yanking as hard as they could, but all they got were handfuls of weeds. President Monson explained, “And then what I thought was the perfect solution came into my eight-year-old mind. I said to Danny, ‘All we need is to set these weeds on fire. We’ll just <em>burn</em> a circle in the weeds!’”</p>
			<p data-aid="130049682" id="p2">Even though he knew he wasn’t allowed to use matches, he ran back to the cabin for some, and he and Danny set a small fire in that grassy spot. They expected it to go out by itself, but it instead grew into a large and dangerous fire. He and Danny ran for help, and soon adults were rushing over to put out the fire before it reached the trees.</p>
			<p data-aid="130049683" id="p3">President Monson continued, “Danny and I learned several difficult but important lessons that day—not the least of which was the importance of obedience.” (See <a class="cross-ref" href="../../../../ensign/2013/05/sunday-morning-session/obedience-brings-blessings.html">“Obedience Brings Blessings,”</a><em> Ensign,</em> May 2013, 89–90.)</p>
			<p data-aid="130049684" id="p4">Like President Monson, have you ever had to learn a lesson in obedience the hard way? What goals can you make to keep yourself safe through obedience in the future?</p>
