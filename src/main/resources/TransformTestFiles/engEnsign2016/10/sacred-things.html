			<p data-aid="130048622" id="p3">A very pointed lesson was presented to me during the Sunday afternoon session of the April 2012 general conference. I sat in front of my computer screen and marveled at the reality of the speaker’s image and the bell-clear tone of his words. With my computer I would also be able to access the speaker’s words for sharing and later listening, or even print a hard copy as a study aid and future reference. It was truly amazing.</p>
			<p data-aid="130048623" id="p4">My eyes wandered across the toolbar at the bottom of my screen. I somehow decided that as long as I could hear the words being spoken, I could easily understand and absorb their meaning while also doing something else at the same time. After all, I was constantly hearing about the wonders of multitasking.</p>
			<p data-aid="130048624" id="p5">It didn’t take long to convince myself. Soon I had opened another tab and was messing with some mindless game whose image effectively covered up the pulpit and the speaker and most of the Tabernacle Choir. I could hear the speaker talking, though. General conference was still streaming live onto my flat-screen monitor.</p>
			<p data-aid="130048625" id="p6">Elder Paul B. Pieper of the Seventy was speaking about how we should hold some things sacred. I heard him say:</p>
			<p data-aid="130048626" id="p7">“<em>Sacred</em> means worthy of veneration and respect. By designating something as sacred, the Lord signals that it is of higher value and priority than other things.”<a class="note-ref" href="#note1"><sup class="marker">1</sup></a></p>
			<p data-aid="130048627" id="p8">I told myself that I agreed with him. Then, as I made another move on my game, I heard Elder Pieper pass on another bit of counsel:</p>
			<p data-aid="130048628" id="p9">“But ‘there is an opposition in all things’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.html?verse=11#p11">2 Nephi 2:11</a>). The opposite of sacred is profane or secular—that which is temporal or worldly. The worldly constantly competes with the sacred for our attention and priorities.”<a class="note-ref" href="#note2"><sup class="marker">2</sup></a></p>
			<p data-aid="130048629" id="p10">I nodded once more—he had my attention now. I listened to his words intently for a few minutes, though I couldn’t see his face behind my game. My multitasking probably wasn’t going as well as I thought it should be. Then I heard Elder Pieper say this:</p>
			<p data-aid="130048630" id="p11">“The sacred cannot be selectively surrendered. Those who choose to abandon even one sacred thing will have their minds darkened (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.html?verse=54#p54">D&amp;C 84:54</a>), and unless they repent, the light they have shall be taken from them (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.html?verse=33#p33">D&amp;C 1:33</a>).”<a class="note-ref" href="#note3"><sup class="marker">3</sup></a></p>
			<p data-aid="130048631" id="p12">Something was nudging the back of my mind. Then a strange thing happened. The edges of my on-screen game began to waver and break into scattered pixels. In just a second or two, everything—including the sound—was gone. My computer had crashed.</p>
			<p data-aid="130048632" id="p13">I shut off the whole system for a couple of minutes. Then I turned it back on and watched the machine reboot. Soon it was up and running. I signed back on to the Church’s website and saw that Elder Pieper had concluded his talk. Conference was again streaming in, clear and true. But I didn’t put my game back on.</p>
			<p data-aid="130048633" id="p14">My computer has certainly crashed on other occasions, but I kept thinking of the last words I heard from Elder Pieper that day. It seemed that my mind was “darkened” when I mixed the worldly with the spiritual, and then that which I still had was taken from me. I know the Lord often teaches us in more subtle ways or requires us to make a greater effort. And I suppose that the reason things happened the way they did could be open to debate, but I had learned a lesson, felt remorse, and repented.</p>
			<p data-aid="130048634" id="p15">A few days later I was able to listen to all of Elder Pieper’s talk and then print it out. What I had lost was restored and renewed, and so was my testimony that “sacred things are to be treated with more care, given greater deference, and regarded with deeper reverence”<a class="note-ref" href="#note4"><sup class="marker">4</sup></a>—especially during general conference.</p>
