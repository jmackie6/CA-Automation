			<p data-aid="127854254" id="p3">Have you ever opened a box of parts, pulled out the assembly instructions, and thought, “This doesn’t make any sense at all”?</p>
			<p data-aid="127854255" id="p4">Sometimes, despite our best intentions and inner confidence, we pull out a part and ask, “What is that for?” or “How does that fit?”</p>
			<p data-aid="127854256" id="p5">Our frustration grows as we look at the box and notice a disclaimer that says, “Assembly required—ages 8 and up.” Because we still don’t have a clue, this does not boost our confidence or our self-esteem.</p>
			<p data-aid="127854257" id="p6">Sometimes we have a similar experience with the gospel. As we look at some part of it, we may scratch our heads and wonder what that part is for. Or as we examine another part, we may realize that even after trying hard to fully understand, we just can’t figure out why that part was included.</p>

				</header>
				<p data-aid="127854259" id="p7">Fortunately, our Heavenly Father has given us wonderful instructions for structuring our lives and putting together our best selves. Those instructions work regardless of our age or circumstance. He has given us the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ. He has given us the plan of redemption, the plan of salvation, even the plan of happiness. He has not left us alone with all the uncertainties or challenges of life, saying, “Here you go. Good luck. Figure it out.”</p>
				<p data-aid="127854260" id="p8">If we will only be patient and look with a humble heart and an open mind, we will find that God has given us many tools to better understand His comprehensive instructions for our happiness in life:</p>
			</section>
			<ul class="bullet">
				<li>
					<p data-aid="127854261" id="p9">He has given us the priceless gift of the Holy Ghost, which has the potential to be our personal, heavenly tutor as we study the word of God and attempt to bring our thoughts and actions into alignment with His word.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p data-aid="127854262" id="p10">He has given us 24/7 access to Him through prayers of faith and supplications of real intent.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p data-aid="127854263" id="p11">He has given us modern-day apostles and prophets, who reveal the word of God in our day and have the authority to bind or seal on earth and in heaven.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p data-aid="127854264" id="p12">He has restored His Church—an organization of believers who work together to help one another as they work out their salvation with fear, trembling, and unparalleled joy.<a class="note-ref" href="#note1"><sup class="marker">1</sup></a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p data-aid="127854265" id="p13">He has given us the holy scriptures—His written word to us.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p data-aid="127854266" id="p14">He has given myriad tools of modern technology to help us in our walk of discipleship. Many of these marvelous instruments can be found at <a href="http://lds.org">LDS.org</a>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<section>
				<p data-aid="127854267" id="p15">Why has our Heavenly Father given us so much help? Because He loves us. And because, as He said of Himself, “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”<a class="note-ref" href="#note2"><sup class="marker">2</sup></a></p>
				<p data-aid="127854268" id="p16">In other words, Heavenly Father is our God, and God is a mentor to us.</p>
				<p data-aid="127854269" id="p17">Our Father in Heaven knows His children’s needs better than anyone else. It is His work and glory to help us at every turn, giving us marvelous temporal and spiritual resources to help us on our path to return to Him.</p>

					<h2 data-aid="127854270" id="title3">Every Father Is a Mentor</h2>
				</header>
				<p data-aid="127854271" id="p18">In some parts of the world, fathers are honored by families and society in the month of June. It is always good to honor and respect our parents. Fathers do many good things for their families and have many admirable attributes. Two of the most important roles fathers have in the lives of their children are those of being a good example and a mentor. Fathers do more than tell their children what is right or wrong; they do much more than toss a manual at them and expect them to figure out life for themselves.</p>
				<p data-aid="127854272" id="p19">Fathers mentor their precious children and show by their good example the way an honest life is lived. Fathers do not leave their children alone but rush to their aid, helping them to their feet whenever they stumble. And sometimes when wisdom suggests, fathers allow their children to struggle, realizing that this may be the best way for them to learn.</p>

					<h2 data-aid="127854273" id="title4">We Are All Mentors</h2>
				</header>
				<p data-aid="127854274" id="p20">While earthly fathers do this for their own children, the spirit of mentoring is something we need to offer all of God’s children, regardless of age, location, or circumstance. Remember, God’s children are our brothers and sisters; we are all of the same eternal family.</p>
				<p data-aid="127854275" id="p21">In this sense, let us all be mentors—eager to reach out and help one another to become our best selves. Because we are God’s offspring, we do have the potential to become like Him. Loving God and our fellowmen, keeping God’s commandments, and following Christ’s example are the straight, narrow, and joyful path back into the presence of our heavenly parents.</p>
				<p data-aid="127854276" id="p22">If the God of the universe cares so much about us that He is a mentor to us, perhaps we too can reach out to our fellowmen, regardless of their color, race, socioeconomic circumstances, language, or religion. Let us become inspired mentors and bless the lives of others—not only our own children but also all of God’s children throughout the world.</p>

				<p data-aid="127854281" id="figure2_p1">You may want to begin by asking those you teach to think of a moment when Heavenly Father mentored them. You could then ask them to think of the similarities between that moment and a moment when they felt mentored by their earthly father. Invite them to write down the similarities in how they were mentored. You could challenge them to try to emulate the thing they wrote down in an effort to be a better example to others.</p>
