			<p data-aid="127853537" id="p1"><strong><a class="cross-ref" href="../../../ensign/2016/06/we-believe-in-following-the-prophet.html">“We Believe in Following the Prophet,”</a></strong> page 8: This article teaches, “As we sustain the prophet and apostles, we gain a testimony of them as servants of God.” You can increase your testimony of prophets by reading or listening to general conference talks. As a family, consider reading one of President Monson’s recent talks and choosing a specific piece of his counsel to live by. As you live what the prophet has asked, try to recognize how you are blessed.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853538" id="p2"><strong><a class="cross-ref" href="../../../ensign/2016/06/come-follow-me-teaching-the-basics-at-home.html">“<em>Come, Follow Me:</em> Teaching the Basics at Home, Part 2,”</a></strong> page 34: President Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985) taught, “Our success, individually and as a Church, will largely be determined by how faithfully we focus on living the gospel at home.” Consider studying a <em>Come, Follow Me</em> topic as a family for a month. You could study aspects of your chosen topic each week, using the scriptures or other study aids like <em>Preach My Gospel,</em> LDS.org, the Topical Guide, and <em>The Life of Christ Bible Videos.</em> At family home evening each week, you could share what you’ve learned and felt. Consider recording your thoughts and impressions in a study journal and sharing what you’ve learned with your friends via social media.</p>

				</header>
				<p data-aid="127853540" id="aside1_p1">For one of our family home evenings, we used some Book of Mormon images from the LDS Media Library (see <a href="http://lds.org/go/picturesE616">lds.org/go/picturesE616</a>) to go along with the story line of the Book of Mormon. The pictures helped to engage our children, who were eager to answer questions about the different stories and prophets we had prepared to discuss with them. The evening was exciting but peaceful. Small and simple things can sometimes make a big difference. In fact, I think this was the best family home evening lesson we’ve had in ages!</p>
