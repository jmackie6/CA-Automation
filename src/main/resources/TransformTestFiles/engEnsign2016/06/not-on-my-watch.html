			<p data-aid="127853654" id="p3">I was close to a family who had a son in Young Men. During an activity while he was a deacon, a leader got after him and embarrassed him in front of his peers. He subsequently felt further discredited, quit attending activities, and sought friends outside his ward.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853656" id="p4">That experience had a tremendous impact on me. I determined that something like that would not happen on my watch if I were called to work with young men. Two years later I was called to work with the deacons.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853658" id="p5">Within a few months I found myself dealing with a young man who was constantly pushing the boundaries in his behavior.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853660" id="p6">“This is the line,” I finally said regarding his actions. “Do not cross it.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127853662" id="p7">He crossed it, we had a bit of a verbal altercation, and he left.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853664" id="p8">Later, I had a chat with him to resolve our differences. I said, “David, I love you and you’re a good young man, but I don’t love some of the things you do. The other young men look to you as a leader, and if they see you getting away with something improper, they may try it as well.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127853666" id="p9">We patched things up, he felt accepted, and we leaders helped temper some of his personal challenges. When he turned 14, he asked me to ordain him a teacher. Today, years later, he gives me a big bear hug whenever he sees me, and he talks with admiration about his time in Young Men.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853667" id="p10">When we love the young men and enjoy being with them, they know it. That’s why my counselors and I took a genuine interest in our young men. We never did an activity just because it was in the book; we did it because we knew the young men would learn a skill, grow, and have fun.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853668" id="p11">On one occasion, we had a young man whose parents were not interested in our program.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853669" id="p12">“That’s OK,” I told them, “but do you mind if your son still comes, learns, and has some fun?”</p>
			<p data-aid="127853670" id="p13">We included him in our program, and before long his parents said OK to his full involvement. They saw that their boy was learning and having fun. Later he served a full-time mission. His younger brother blossomed as well and also served a mission.</p>
			<p data-aid="127853671" id="p14">We saw a correlation between leaders taking an interest in a young man and that young man learning, growing, and eventually serving a mission. It’s satisfying to watch young men grow, and it’s enjoyable to learn with them. The key to our success was to love them while we served them.</p>
