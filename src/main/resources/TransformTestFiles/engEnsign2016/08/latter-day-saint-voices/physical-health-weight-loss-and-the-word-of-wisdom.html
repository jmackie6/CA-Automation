			<p data-aid="129087908" id="p3">In my mid-60s, it was getting harder for me to get around. I weighed almost 300 pounds (136 kg). I had low energy and stamina and even obtained a handicapped parking permit so that I could park as close to stores as possible.</p>
			<p data-aid="129087909" id="p4">I decided it was time to lose weight. I turned to <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.html">Doctrine and Covenants 89</a> and prayed to Heavenly Father, “Help me to understand what this is really telling me.” Over time each verse, each word took on new meaning. Even though I don’t drink alcohol, tea, or coffee, and I don’t smoke, I hadn’t really absorbed the overall message. I knew the Word of Wisdom was a health code, but I had never before thought of it as a way of life.</p>
			<p data-aid="129087910" id="p5">For the first time I truly felt that I could change my lifestyle. I set a realistic goal of losing 50 pounds (23 kg) in 50 weeks.</p>
			<p data-aid="129087911" id="p6">I kept track of my calories and nutrients. I researched the health benefits of everything I ate. As I ate healthier foods, I felt satisfied. I had no cravings. My body seemed to know what it needed. Unhealthy food I used to enjoy lost its appeal. I quit eating sugar. Over time, I quit counting calories and ate plant-based foods, as the Word of Wisdom says: “that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.html?verse=16#p16">D&amp;C 89:16</a>). I met my goal and more. In just over 23 months I had lost over half my body weight. That’s 12 dress sizes smaller! I have now maintained that weight for over three years.</p>
			<p data-aid="129087912" id="p7">I feel healthy. I no longer have blood-sugar spikes when I’m hungry, and I can’t remember the last time I had a headache. I don’t have to take medications. While losing weight has contributed to my overall feeling of well-being, my new lifestyle does also.</p>
			<p data-aid="129087913" id="p8">Controlling the things I eat is part of overcoming the natural man (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.html?verse=19#p19">Mosiah 3:19</a>). In turn, it tweaks my spiritual discernment, allowing me to receive the promise that I “shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.html?verse=19#p19">D&amp;C 89:19</a>). Giving up fast food for wisdom is a good trade-off.</p>
			<p data-aid="129087914" id="p9">I am most grateful to a loving Heavenly Father who heard my simple plea and gave me insight into the Word of Wisdom. I know the Word of Wisdom is revelation. I know it can change lives.</p>
