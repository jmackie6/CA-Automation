After reading this article together as a family, you could invite each member of the family to list the reasons <em>they</em> love the Book of Mormon. Consider having each person share their list and their favorite scripture from the Book of Mormon. You could make a goal to look for more reasons to love the Book of Mormon as you read it together regularly.</p>
			<p data-aid="129087078" id="p2"><strong><a class="cross-ref" href="../../../ensign/2016/08/stepping-across-the-mississippi.html">“Stepping across the Mississippi,”</a></strong> page 60. Begin by reading about the author’s experience of stepping across the Mississippi River at a spot where it was a narrow stream. Point out that the daily choices we make are like small streams that flow together to form a river. Consider asking family members to identify some “spiritually strengthening streams,” or good habits, that could help their lives be as “rivers of righteousness” (see page 61 for some ideas). You could set a goal to work on one of these habits as a family during the coming week. To close, you might want to watch the video “Selfies or Scriptures” (<a href="http://lds.org/go/choicesE816">lds.org/go/choicesE816</a>).</p>

				<p data-aid="129087080" id="aside1_p1">When our children were young, my husband and I worried that they didn’t know the contact information they might need in an emergency: parents’ full names, phone numbers, and address. So we made up a song using our family’s information, set to the tune of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,” and taught it to our children for family night. In a short time they were singing their new song perfectly. We were also careful to teach them this was private information to be shared only in an emergency. Now if they were ever lost, our children would have a family jingle that could help them be guided to safety.</p>
