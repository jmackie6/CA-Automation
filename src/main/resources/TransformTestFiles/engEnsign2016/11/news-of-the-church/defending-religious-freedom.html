			<p data-aid="130968594" id="p1">Latter-day Saints should be involved “in a constructive way in the vital contest for religious freedom,” said Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at a religious freedom conference in Texas, USA, in September 2016. “Literally everyone—from kindergarten children through the ranks of professionals and mothers and fathers and friends and neighbors—can and should understand what religious freedom is and why it is important.”</p>
			<p data-aid="130968595" id="p2">Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles also spoke in defense of religious freedom at a patriotic service in Utah, USA, in June. “Recently,” he said, “it has become popular to argue that the freedom of religion is really only the right to worship rather than the right to freely exercise your faith in your daily life.” He encouraged people of faith to stand up for religious freedom by becoming informed, speaking up, and getting involved in cultural, civic, and political organizations and events.</p>
			<p data-aid="130968596" id="p3">Church leaders have repeatedly addressed the subject of religious freedom, delivering speeches and participating in conferences in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and the United Kingdom and at various locations in the USA.
