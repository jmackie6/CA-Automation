			<p data-aid="127848604" id="p1">The passing of a loved one is often a very tender time, filled with soul-searching and self-reflection for those left behind. Many wonder, as did Job in ancient times, “If a man die, shall he live again?” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/ot/job/14.html?verse=14#p14">Job 14:14</a>). This poignant question seems particularly appropriate during this time of year, the Easter season, as we remember the Savior’s Atonement and celebrate His glorious Resurrection.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848605" id="p2">Because of His Atonement and Resurrection, the Lord Jesus Christ is able to heal every pain, understand every heartache, and overcome every loss. From the Book of Mormon we learn:</p>
			<p data-aid="127848606" id="p3">“And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848607" id="p4">“And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/bofm/alma/7.html?verse=11-12#p11">Alma 7:11–12</a>).</p>
			<p data-aid="127848608" id="p5">Through trials great and small, as each of us seeks to find the Savior, to love Him, and to follow Him, we will find strength in Him. These truths are what inspired George Frideric Handel to compose his magnificent oratorio <em>Messiah.</em> Its “Hallelujah Chorus” is a majestic declaration of testimony and love for the Savior. During this Easter season, with its celebration of new life through Christ, we can find peace and joy for ourselves through our faith in Jesus Christ and help others draw closer to the Lord of lords and King of kings by sharing with them our beliefs about the Atonement and Resurrection.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848609" id="p6">Beginning March 13, visit <a href="http://FollowHim.mormon.org">FollowHim.mormon.org</a> to view a powerful new video celebrating the Savior’s victory over sin and death. You can also share your testimony of what Easter means to you on social media using the hashtag #Hallelujah.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848610" id="p7">President Thomas S. Monson has taught:</p>
			<p data-aid="127848611" id="p8">“To all who have lost loved ones, we would turn Job’s question to an answer: If a man die, he <em>shall</em> live again. We know, for we have the light of revealed truth. ‘I am the resurrection, and the life,’ spoke the Master. ‘He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die’ [<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/nt/john/11.html?verse=25-26#p25">John 11:25–26</a>].</p>
			<p data-aid="127848612" id="p9">“Through tears and trials, through fears and sorrows, through the heartache and loneliness of losing loved ones, there is assurance that life is everlasting. Our Lord and Savior is the living witness that such is so” (“I Know That My Redeemer Lives!” <em>Ensign,</em> May 2007, 25).</p>
