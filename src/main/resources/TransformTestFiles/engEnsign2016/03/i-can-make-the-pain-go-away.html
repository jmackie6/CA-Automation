			<p data-aid="127848715" id="p3">At the beginning of my junior year of college, my mother and father filed for divorce. Even though the decision came after two years of separation, the effects were searing. I felt physical pain and often couldn’t sleep. Even more heartbreaking was to see my siblings—the youngest was only six years old—try to cope with this life-shattering event.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848716" id="p4">My own way to cope was to work harder. In addition to a full load of college courses, I took on a part-time internship and two part-time jobs. I also began to play with the city’s symphony. I often spent 15 to 18 hours a day on school and work. No matter how busy I kept myself, nothing I did helped.</p>

			<p data-aid="127848718" id="p5">I did try to invite the Spirit into my life. I had always been active in the Church, and I knew I should draw closer to God during trials. I kept up daily scripture study and prayer, which brought some peace. But still, none of my burdens lifted.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848719" id="p6">About six weeks into the semester, my roommate asked our home teachers for a priesthood blessing. While I sat on the couch and listened, the Spirit prompted me to ask for a blessing too. As soon as their hands were on my head, I felt the Spirit enter my heart. I hardly heard a word they spoke, but I received a clear message. It was as if Heavenly Father whispered, “Why aren’t you letting me help you?”</p>
			<p data-aid="127848720" id="p7">After weeks of controlling my emotions, I sobbed. I saw that I had been making only a token effort to seek the Lord’s help. I had been convinced that I had to be strong and do everything myself and do it all perfectly. I had forgotten that I had a Savior who understood, through His suffering, my pain, my anger, my weakness. Now I saw that when everything in my world was crashing to pieces, I had only one secure place to stand—upon the rock of my Redeemer.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848721" id="p8">Each morning after receiving the blessing, I pleaded for the Lord’s help. I asked Him to enable me to complete my assignments. I asked Him to allow me to feel joy and peace again. I asked Him to lift the heaviness from my heart. Slowly, my life changed; slowly my burdens lifted.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848722" id="p9">A verse in the Book of Mormon explains how the Lord helps those struggling with sin: “Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart <em>and</em> a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.html?verse=7#p7">2 Nephi 2:7</a>; emphasis added). I believe He helps those struggling with other burdens the same way. I had a broken heart, but it wasn’t until I had a contrite spirit that I was able to feel the peace the Savior offers.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848723" id="p10">Although that time in my life was difficult, it allowed me to know that Jesus Christ was not just <em>the</em> Savior. He is <em>my</em> Savior. He bore <em>my</em> griefs and carried <em>my</em> sorrows, and with His stripes <em>I</em> am healed (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/ot/isa/53.html?verse=4-5#p4">Isaiah 53:4–5</a>).</p>
