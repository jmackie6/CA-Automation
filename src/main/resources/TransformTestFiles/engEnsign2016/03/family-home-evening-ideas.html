			<p data-aid="127847678" id="p1"><strong><a class="cross-ref" href="../../../ensign/2016/03/finding-your-life.html">“Finding Your Life,”</a></strong> page 24: Begin by singing together “I’ll Go Where You Want Me to Go” (<em>Hymns,</em> no. 270). Then consider reading the account of Jesus asking His disciples to take up their crosses and follow Him (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/nt/matt/16.html?verse=24-26#p24">Matthew 16:24–26</a>). Discuss what it means to lose one’s life for Christ’s sake, highlighting insights from the article. Elder Christofferson states that “the greatest illustration of saving one’s life by losing it is this: ‘O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/nt/matt/26.html?verse=42#p42">Matthew 26:42</a>).” What can we learn from Jesus Christ’s example? Invite family members to consider what they can do in the coming week to lose their lives in the Savior’s service.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847679" id="p2"><strong><a class="cross-ref" href="../../../ensign/2016/03/the-light-of-the-perfect-day.html">“The Light of the Perfect Day,”</a></strong> page 64: Begin the lesson by turning off the lights in the room. As you turn on a small flashlight, explain that this light represents the Light of Christ in all of Heavenly Father’s children. Turn on the room lights, and teach that the brighter light represents the gift of the Holy Ghost. You may wish to discuss Elder Lawrence’s statement that “our spirits grow brighter when we feed them light.” Share the five ways of obtaining light suggested in the article (see the summary list on page 66), and set goals for obtaining more light in the next week.</p>

				</header>
				<p data-aid="127847681" id="aside1_p1">When my son Jasper was six, he gave a family home evening lesson in which he talked about the upcoming general conference and why it was important that we watch it. Next he showed individual pictures of the Twelve Apostles and the members of the First Presidency with their names covered up. He then challenged the rest of us to see if we could remember each of their names. As the lesson ended, it gave me an opportunity to testify that I knew that these leaders were called of God and that there is something very special about each of them.</p>
