			<p data-aid="127848753" id="p3">I sat in my living room crying. It had been only a few days since I had had a miscarriage, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the loss of our baby. So many things reminded me of the tragedy, especially my closet full of maternity clothes.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848754" id="p4">Every time I went into my room, the clothes seemed to stare at me from their hangers. Most of them were brand new and never worn, reminding me that I was no longer pregnant. I was still too weak to stand up for more than a few seconds to put them away.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848755" id="p5">Suddenly someone knocked on my door. When I opened it, I saw my visiting teacher standing on the doorstep. It was the same visiting teacher who had been watching my children when my doctor confirmed to my husband and me that I had miscarried.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848756" id="p6">“Is there anything I can do for you?” she asked.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848757" id="p7">“Yes,” I said. “I need your help putting away my maternity clothes.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127848758" id="p8">I led her into the bedroom, emptied drawers, and stripped hangers. Then I lay in bed while she folded my clothes and gently laid them in boxes. After she had taped the boxes and carried them downstairs so I wouldn’t have to look at them, I felt my spirits lift.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848759" id="p9">Afterward she went into the kitchen, loaded the dishwasher, wiped the counters, and tidied up—things I still wasn’t able to do. When she left, my house was clean, my clothes were out of sight, and my heart wasn’t quite so heavy anymore.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848760" id="p10">The Apostle John taught, “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.html?verse=18#p18">1 John 4:18</a>). When we reach out to share the Savior’s love, we are strengthened by His courage. Because my visiting teacher was filled with the love of Christ, she came immediately when the Spirit prompted her to come.</p>
			<p data-aid="127848761" id="p11">We received many expressions of love during that terrible time, including flowers, cards, cupcakes, and childcare, all of which we appreciated. But the expression that helped the most was when my visiting teacher, not knowing how badly I needed her, knocked on my door, and asked, “Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>
