			<p data-aid="127847800" id="p3">One weekend I woke up and was unable to hear in my left ear. I called an ear, nose, and throat doctor and made an appointment.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847801" id="p4">The doctor immediately sent me to an audiologist for a hearing test. I began to worry when I could not hear any of the test sounds in my left ear. At the end of the test, the audiologist concluded that I had sensorineural hearing loss, meaning a cranial nerve used in hearing was damaged.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847802" id="p5">I was shocked. I was only 26 years old and was already discussing the need for a hearing aid. One of my biggest passions is music. Would I still be able to play my instruments and sing?</p>
			<p data-aid="127847803" id="p6">The doctor prescribed a steroid to see if it would help, but he was positive my hearing loss was permanent.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847804" id="p7">My emotions soon got the better of me, and tears flooded my eyes. I was afraid of what the future would bring, and I was sad that I would never hear normally again.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847805" id="p8">That night my husband, Brian, suggested that he give me a priesthood blessing. I expected that the blessing would give me comfort and strength to deal with my hearing loss, but instead Brian promised in his blessing that my hearing would be fully restored. I couldn’t believe it.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847806" id="p9">“My husband must be mistaken,” I thought. The doctor had seen many cases like mine and said that my hearing would not return.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847807" id="p10">Afterward, I asked Brian if he thought the promised blessing was his will or the Lord’s. Brian told me he had felt a strong prompting to make the promise. I wasn’t convinced.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847808" id="p11">As I pondered my condition, I remembered a scripture in the book of Mark where Jesus tells a desperate father that “all things are possible to him that believeth.” The man responded, “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../../scriptures/nt/mark/9.html?verse=23-24#p23">Mark 9:23–24</a>). This was my plea to my Heavenly Father that night. I wanted to believe that I would be healed, but I was unsure. I lacked faith the Lord would help me in my crisis.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847809" id="p12">After my prayer I thought about a lesson I had taught the young women about the power of priesthood blessings. I had told the class to ask for blessings and that the Lord can heal the sick through blessings. How could I expect them to believe me if I lacked faith? I decided to put my trust in the Lord—He had not lied to me before.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847810" id="p13">Two weeks later, my hearing completely returned. The audiologist and doctor were shocked.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847811" id="p14">I will forever be grateful to Heavenly Father that my hearing was restored, but I am even more grateful for the lesson I learned. Even if it’s not always in the way we are promised in a blessing, I know the Lord will bless us if we put our faith and trust in Him.</p>
