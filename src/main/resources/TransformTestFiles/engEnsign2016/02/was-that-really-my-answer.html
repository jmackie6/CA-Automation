			<p data-aid="127847508" id="p3">It was Sunday evening, and once again I needed to choose a new second counselor for our Primary presidency. Because of rapid population growth, our small neighborhood had experienced many ward boundary changes in a short amount of time; in two and a half years I had already worked with several counselors.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847509" id="p4">Because the Lord had guided my thoughts in the past when someone was needed to fill a calling, I did not doubt His loving hand would be there to guide me again. As I prayed and then reviewed the names on the ward list, I paused at one sister’s name but then quickly dismissed the idea. Because we had such a large Primary, I wanted to find a sister who had experience serving in the organization. This sister, however, had joined the Church as an adult and had never attended Primary, and she had never had a Primary calling. I simply didn’t think she was the one I was looking for.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847510" id="p5">I pondered and prayed the rest of the week. By Saturday, I still had no name to give the bishop. I decided to go on a walk, and while I was out I stopped by the home of the second counselor in the bishopric. He asked if I had made a decision about the calling yet. I said I hadn’t received any inspiration, aside from the one name that I knew wasn’t <em>really</em> it. He asked me why I thought this way, and I listed all the reasons I believed that particular sister wouldn’t work out.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847511" id="p6">After I presented my case, this wise leader told me, “Maybe you should go home and try praying again, because it sounds to me like you’ve already received your answer.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127847512" id="p7">I did as he advised and prayed again, acknowledging that Heavenly Father knew who should fill the calling and asking Him to help me feel at peace.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847513" id="p8">The next morning, as I walked into the bishop’s office for a meeting, the bishop asked if I would share a spiritual thought. I sat down and opened my scriptures to one of my favorite passages. I had read it many times, but this time I felt the Spirit of the Lord confirming the truthfulness of its words, and I was filled with the peace I had been seeking. I read:</p>
			<p data-aid="127847514" id="p9">“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847515" id="p10">“For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/ot/isa/55.html?verse=8-9#p8">Isaiah 55:8–9</a>).</p>
			<p data-aid="127847516" id="p11">In my mind and my heart, I knew that the sister whose name I had been given was who the Lord wanted—for His purposes, not mine.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847517" id="p12">Once called, this wonderful, qualified sister brought energy and enthusiasm to our Primary. She was eager to learn and willing to serve, and she loved the Primary children. She was a great asset to the Primary presidency for the six months we served together.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847518" id="p13">Soon after my release as Primary president, the military relocated this sister’s husband, and her family moved from our ward.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847519" id="p14">We lost track of each other for the next seven or eight years. But one day at church I saw her. She and her family had come for a visit, and after happily greeting me, she asked if I was still in the Primary. I told her I was, now as music leader. She then explained that her husband was stationed in Japan, where their family had been living for about three years. They attended a small branch, and she had made many friends.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847520" id="p15">The words that followed overtook me with a wave of emotion. “I am serving in the Primary presidency in my branch in Japan,” she told me. “The leaders were very excited when they heard that I had served in a Primary presidency, as they were not really sure how a Primary was supposed to run.”</p>
			<p data-aid="127847523" id="p16">How humbled and grateful I felt at that moment. The words from Isaiah came flooding back to my mind. It was then that I better understood the meaning of the scripture, and of His ways. With my limited vision and selfish desires, I had seen only my ways, but the Lord had a divine purpose for calling this sister. I am grateful that He answers our prayers, though sometimes in unexpected ways, and that He has a plan for each of us.</p>
