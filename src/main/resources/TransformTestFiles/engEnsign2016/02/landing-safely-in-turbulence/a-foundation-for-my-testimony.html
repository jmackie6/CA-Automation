			<p data-aid="127847257" id="p3">When I was 16, a friend showed up at our home with the missionaries. Within a month of the first discussion, all my questions were answered in clarity. I felt the Holy Ghost testify of the truthfulness of the messages about the Restoration. It was unlike anything I had ever felt, and I knew all of it was true.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847258" id="p4">However, I experienced more rejection and opposition than ever before. I felt alone, tired, and confused. If I was doing the right thing, why was I encountering so much adversity? I couldn’t understand how my trials were for my good. The missionaries taught me to fast and pray, even in the middle of a school day. When things became unbearable I’d pour out my heart and immediately feel the comfort of the Spirit.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847259" id="p5">The week of my baptism was full of trials. My boss threatened to fire me if I didn’t skip my baptism to fill in for someone, I ended up in the hospital with kidney stones, and my parents asked me to leave our home. With so many things out of my control, the only thing I could do was turn to the Lord.</p>
			<p data-aid="127847260" id="p6">Every one of those trials <em>did</em> turn out to be for my benefit. They helped me learn about the doctrines of the gospel, which provided me a foundation for my testimony.</p>
