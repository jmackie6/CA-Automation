					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan an activity with the missionaries where you invite less-active members and friends not of our faith to take a tour of the Church building. The missionaries should be in charge of giving the tour. Tours often begin in the foyer, where participants gather for an opening prayer. Then the missionaries lead the group to the baptismal font (if your chapel has one) and explain about our need for the Atonement of Jesus Christ. They may take time to point out the artwork around the building, and they may use this artwork to teach about the restored gospel. Tours often end in the chapel by the sacrament table, where the missionaries teach about the sacrament and our need to make and renew covenants with God. Depending on the guidance of the Spirit and the circumstances of the tour, the missionaries may extend invitations to learn more about the gospel, attend church, or be baptized.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Throughout the tour, you will be invited to bear testimony of gospel principles. You can prepare for this experience by studying topics such as the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Restoration of the gospel, the sacrament, and baptism. You could also prepare by asking the missionaries to give you a tour before you invite others to participate.</p>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elder Neil L. Anderson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has challenged Latter-day Saint youth to find the names of ancestors who need temple ordinances performed for them and to go to the temple to receive those ordinances. Plan an activity with the youth in your ward or branch to watch the <a href="/topics/family-history/temple-challenge?cid=ld-tc-1016">new video</a> about this challenge. After watching the video, invite the youth to use phones, mobile devices, or a computer to accept the challenge and add their names to the counter on <a href="/topics/family-history/temple-challenge?cid=ld-tc-1016">templechallenge.lds.org</a>. Counsel with your adult leaders about setting a goal as a ward or branch to help all the youth accept the challenge and complete the goal. Use the Youth Temple Challenge website to discuss the four steps needed to complete the goal. As a group, make a plan and set dates to help one another <a href="/youth/activities/temple-and-family-history/family-roots/learn-about-an-ancestor">find family names on FamilySearch.org</a> and then go to the temple to <a href="/youth/activities/temple-and-family-history/temple-ordinances/baptisms-for-the-dead">receive baptisms and confirmations for the people you have found</a>. As you search for and find ancestors and go to the temple, consider documenting your experiences with photos and videos and sharing them on social media. You could post your photos and stories using the hashtag #TempleChallenge to inspire youth around the world to accept the challenge too. </p>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geocaching is when an individual or team uses a GPS-enabled device to locate a geocache, or container, that is hidden in an area. There are thousands of geocaches in cities, towns, and forests across the world. In order to go geocaching, you will need to obtain the coordinates for a nearby geocache and attempt to find it using a GPS-enabled device. For an ideal experience, groups of two to four people should go geocaching, making sure that each member has an opportunity to navigate with the GPS.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan a series of activities to help you learn how to go geocaching. These activities should be planned by various team members and chosen from the following five fields of emphasis. You should also choose and plan a culminating activity—such as a geocaching treasure hunt with other Varsity teams—from one of the fields of emphasis.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All Scouts and adult leaders will need to have a smartphone or other GPS-enabled device. You will also need to search the Internet to find geocaching websites, coordinates, and applications.</p>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan and carry out an overnight camping trip (this could be more than one night). Invite the youth to lead the planning—location, meals, activities, equipment, spiritual experiences, and so on. During the campout, help the youth learn a new skill (such as fire safety, fishing, outdoor survival, and so on). Include activities that are fun and spiritual. For Church policies on overnight activities, see <em>Handbook 2,</em> <a href="/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/activities#13.6.12">13.6.12</a>.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consider helping the youth prepare for the camping trip by teaching them basic camping skills before you leave. Ideas could include:</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<li>How to build a safe cooking fire.</li>
						<li>How to set up and take down a tent.</li>
						<li>How to prepare and cook food in the outdoors.</li>
						<li>Basic first aid.</li>
						<li>How to stay safe in the outdoors (buddy system, what to do if you get lost, and so on).</li>
						<li>Appropriate clothing for climate and environment.</li>
						<li>How to respect the environment and wildlife.</li>
					</ul>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If applicable, let the youth practice these skills in a friendly competition. For example, you could divide the youth into  groups and see who can set up their tent the fastest or hold a Mutual activity in which the young men and young women cook for each other in the outdoors.</p>

Youth around the world had the chance to ask Lindsey questions, moderated by Young Men general president David L. Beck and Young Women general president Bonnie L. Oscarson. Lindsey shared her story—including how she learned to recognize her worth, how she shares the gospel, and how she has risen above criticism to make a unique contribution to the world. Lindsey performed live songs at the event―one song featured special guest Lexi Walker singing “I Know That My Redeemer Lives” arranged by Kendra Lowe.</p>

						<a href="http://www.lindseystirling.com/" itemprop="url">
							<span itemprop="name">Lindsey Stirling</span>
						</a> is a dancing, hip hop violinist and a self-made success story. Her video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjpOzsQ9YI">Crystallize</a>” has over 100 million views on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lindseystomp">YouTube</a>. Lindsey is a returned missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In her <a href="http://www.mormon.org/lindsey">I’m a Mormon</a> profile she talks about how her faith has helped her overcome trials in her life, including an eating disorder. She’s known for her unique personality and musical style, incorporating dubstep into her music and covering songs like “Radioactive” by Imagine Dragons and even her own versions of the “Zelda,” “Skyrim” and “Pokemon” theme songs. Lindsey said, “I was told by so many people that I wouldn't succeed because I was too different. Ironically, the very reason that people watch my channel and travel thousands of miles to see a show … is because it’s different. God didn’t send us to earth to just blend in. We are here to share what makes us unique.” Whatever Lindsey does, she does it in her own way, and she enjoys having a close and direct relationship with her fans. She’s currently on tour in Europe promoting her new album <em>Shatter Me.</em>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Use a game to teach a story or principle from the scriptures. Here are some ideas:</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Read and discuss scripture passages about the armor of God (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.10-17">Ephesians 6:10–17</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.15-18">D&amp;C 27:15–18</a>). Consider the significance of each piece of the armor. Build armor with your class or quorum out of inexpensive material, such as cardboard or paper. Find creative ways, such as an obstacle course, to show how this armor could protect them from spiritual danger.</li>
						<li>Play scripture Battleship by tying a rope between two trees and hanging long blankets from the rope so the people on one side of the blankets cannot see the people on the other side. Divide the participants into two teams and ask them to lie or sit down on either side of the rope (they can’t move after they do). Adult leaders will present challenging situations (such as “Your friend invites you to a drinking party”). The first person to name a scripture that would help them in each situation can throw a ball to the other side of the blankets. If the ball hits someone, that person is out. Continue playing until all the youth on one side of the blankets are out.</li>
						<li>Bake a few cakes. Divide your class or quorum into groups, and give them appropriate stories from the scriptures (such as the parable of the good Samaritan or Daniel in the lion’s den). Invite them to decorate a cake to illustrate their scripture story. Have the youth share their cakes and invite others to guess the scripture stories they have illustrated. Have those who decorated the cake share a few key scriptures from the story and teach how the principles in the story apply in their lives. Then eat the cakes.</li>
						<li>Play a game such as dodgeball or tag. If a youth gets tagged out, he or she can get back into the game only by quoting or paraphrasing a scripture mastery passage. To make the game more challenging, allow each scripture mastery passage to be used only once.</li>

						<li>Ahead of time, prepare cards with topics from <em>For the Strength of Youth</em> on them. Below each topic, list words related to that topic (for “Entertainment and Media,” you might list, “television,” “computer,” “watch,” “video,” or “movie”). Divide the youth into teams. Have a player from each team give clues to his or her team to guess the topic without the player using any of the words on the card. If the team guesses the topic in a certain amount of time, have the team member who guessed correctly use the words on the card to role-play how he or she would share the Lord’s standards on that topic with a friend (you might want to provide a situation in which the standards are being questioned). If the team doesn’t guess the topic in the required time, have the person who was giving the clues role-play using the words on the card to explain the Lord’s standards with a friend.</li>
						<li>Write on a piece of paper several of our standards (Word of Wisdom, Sabbath day, law of chastity, tithing, and so on) and place them in a bowl. Divide the youth up into teams. Have each team randomly select a standard from the bowl. Give them about five minutes to discuss how they can best explain and teach the standard they chose to a peer. After the teams have discussed their chosen standards, choose members of each team to represent their group in role-playing a situation in which they must explain their standard to a peer with questions. Repeat the discussions and role-playing for a few rounds.</li>
						<li>Have youth bring a small sample of food that can be used to represent a standard from <em>For the Strength of Youth,</em> such as a fruit with a peel representing modest dress. Have the youth present their examples and give mini-lessons about the standards they relate to. Ask them to tell a personal story about an experience they have had with that standard.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the help of your adult leaders, organize a series of activities to prepare for a safe and exciting backpacking trip. These activities could take place over a number of weeks. For each activity, include something, such as a devotional, to invite the Holy Ghost. Following is a list of activity ideas:</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<strong>Introduction to backpacking.</strong> Invite an experienced hiker to use maps, pictures, videos, and sample gear to introduce the young women to backpacking. Make sure you understand what clothing and footwear to wear for backpacking. Learn the principles of how to pack a backpack, such as keeping your fuel separate from your clothing and food and packing emergency items so they are readily available. Be careful not to overestimate the amount you can carry or the distance you can hike. Always hike with a partner, and travel at a pace that is comfortable for everyone in the group.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cooking.</strong> Find and practice some backpacking recipes that use lightweight ingredients and equipment, such as a backpacking stove. Have each young woman in your class compile a menu for a backpacking trip.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Conditioning and practice hikes.</strong> Find some local hikes in your area that have trails similar to the area where you will be backpacking. Complete two or three practice hikes, and make sure you learn how to camp and hike without leaving a trace. You should complete one of the hikes while carrying all your backpacking gear.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Fires, shelters, and survival skills.</strong> Practice with a variety of fire-starting materials, tents, and other supplies to gain experience backpacking and camping with appropriate supplies. Plan what you will bring on your trip. Make sure you learn how to waterproof matches and properly extinguish fires so they are completely out.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Map and compass navigation.</strong> Plan a backpacking trip using a map of some trails near where you live. Learn and practice how to navigate in the wilderness using a compass and map. Learn how to set up distress beacons or signals in the wilderness.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Service project for local hikers.</strong> Arrange with public officials for a project to build or maintain trails in your area.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Trip plan and packing list.</strong> With your class and your adult and priesthood leaders, develop a detailed, written trip plan that includes a purpose statement, a full schedule with times and activities, routes, directions to trailheads, emergency contact information, and maps. Stick to your route. Make contingency plans in case something unexpected happens, including inclement weather. Make sure you know what resources, such as water, will be available in that area. Prepare a packing list that includes packing in water or equipment to purify water. Also assign devotionals and prepare for nightly reflections, group prayers, journal writing, and scripture reading.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Backpacking trip.</strong> Make the final arrangements for the backpacking trip, giving top priority to safety. Take the trip and use the skills you learned to get ready for this trip.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan some activities that will help you learn the basic principles of outdoor sanitation, and follow these principles during your stay at Young Women camp. Keeping a campsite sanitary will improve the health, comfort, and safety of the young women at camp. You may want to plan some activities where you practice the following sanitation guidelines and other rules specific to your area. For example, you could plan an overnight camping activity where you give the young women a chance to practice these guidelines. You could also do many of these activities during a weekday Mutual activity.</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Find out about the environment of your camp. Avoid camping near sites where pestilent insects breed, such as stagnant pools, marshes, neglected latrines or shelters, and dumps. Make a plan to control the amount of insects, rodents, and poisonous plants in your camp. You should also avoid camping anywhere that may disturb natural vegetation or waterways.</li>
						<li>Prepare soap-on-a-rope to use at your camp by tying a small bar of soap onto a thin piece of rope. Then hang this soap on a pole near where you eat, by the latrines, and outside each tent. Make sure that each young woman has a small bottle of hand sanitizer gel. You could also designate special cleanup areas of your campsite by roping them off. If your campsite is wet or muddy, build a small drain or place some gravel on the ground to reduce the muddiness.</li>
						<li>Learn about the animals around your campsite. If there are scavenging animals (such as bears or gulls), plan ways to keep your food safe in a secure location or container. Do not keep any food near the area where you sleep. Be aware of any food smells that may remain on your clothing, and change and store or wash your clothes before you go to bed. Keep all refuse in secure containers.</li>
						<li>Become familiar with the trash regulations of your campsite. Each day, dispose of all camp trash in one of two ways: burn it or remove it from the site and throw it away in dumpster or trashcan. At some sites, you may need to use both ways. Follow the regulations for trash disposal in your area. Recycle as many items as possible.</li>
						<li>Keep the ground of your campsite clean from any food or garbage. Make sure any garbage cans or bags are clean and dry. To protect food or garbage from ants or other insects, use racks, rocks, or some other base to keep the containers off the ground.</li>
						<li>Clean outdoor toilets every day. If necessary, learn how to build a latrine.</li>
					</ul>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you are hiking or camping away from a latrine or toilet, follow the rules for burying human waste. Make sure you are 200 feet (61 m) away from any water supply or camp area. Use your heel or a stick to dig a shallow hole. All human waste should go in the hole. When you finish, refill the hole with dirt and cover the area with natural ground cover.</p>

For example, you could give an award for the cleanest camper, the best helper, the best hiker, the best storyteller, and so forth. This ceremony could be held on the last night of camp or after camp is finished. Remember to pay attention to the young women during camp from the first day onward and make notes of the positive things they do. Your awards should be meaningful and account for each young woman.</p>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan an activity where you learn how to build campfires safely and extinguish them completely. Contact your local fire department and become aware, before you start, of the fire regulations and rules for the area where you will build a fire. Some fire departments may be willing to send a representative to teach you about fire safety. You could also plan a longer activity, such as an overnight campout, where you can use the skills you have learned. You may find the following list helpful as you plan these activities.</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<strong>Gathering fuel.</strong> Learn about the different types of fuel needed for a fire, such as tinder, kindling, and logs. Use only dead wood. Make sure you know how to work with coal if you want to build a coal fire. Gather your fuel in a pile near where you want to build the fire. Make sure the area is clear from tree branches, and check with local officials before lighting any outdoor fire.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Types of fires.</strong> Build your fire in a fire ring or pit that already exists if possible. You should only build a fire in areas where you’re permitted to burn a wood fire. Learn about and practice the different types of fires. Tepee fires, for example, create high flames and will help cook food in reflector ovens. Crisscross fires burn for a long time and create a deep bed of coals, which can be useful in Dutch oven cooking. Star fires create low, slow heat that can be used in spit cooking.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Maintain the fire.</strong> Keep your campfire at a manageable size. Never leave your fire unattended, and never collect wood or branches from live trees or other underbrush.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Waterproof matches.</strong> Learn how to waterproof your matches using Turpentine, nail polish, or candle wax. Create or find a waterproof container to store them in.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Start a fire without matches.</strong> Learn how to start fires using flint and steel, a magnifying glass, or a bow drill.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Extinguishing fires.</strong> Learn to extinguish campfires using dirt, sand, or water. Drown all embers, stir the ashes, and make sure that everything is wet and cold to the touch. If it’s too hot to touch, then it’s too hot to leave unattended. Make sure you know how to clean up your fire pit so that you leave no trace of your campsite. Learn how to use fire extinguishers, and become familiar with other fire safety equipment. You could invite local fire safety officials to teach you how to deal with accidental or dangerous fires.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan an activity to test your knowledge of the gospel and Church history. Before the activity, an adult leader should write a list of questions and answers about Church history and the gospel. The answers should be found in the <a href="/scriptures">scriptures</a>, <em>
							<a href="/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth">For the Strength of Youth</a>,</em> and <em>
							<a href="/manual/true-to-the-faith">True to the Faith</a>.</em> For example, you might ask, “What person appeared to Joseph Smith three times in his room during one night?” The answer is <em>Moroni.</em> Write the answers to the questions on paper plates or plain pieces of paper. On the same paper plates or papers, draw colored dots. Then spread out the dots on the ground or floor.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Divide the young women into two groups. An adult leader should read one of the questions on the list. One young woman from each group should then race to find the dot with the correct answer to the question. Once the young woman finds the answer, she stands on the dot. She stays there until the game ends. The other young woman has to return to her team. The winning team is the one that has more team members standing on dots by the end of the game. Make sure each young woman has a chance to participate.</p>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organize a series of activities that will help you prepare for and participate in a one- or two-day cycling trip. These activities could take place over a number of weeks. Consider inviting a cyclist from your Church unit or community to help with some of the activities, and make sure to stay safe.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each activity, consider including a devotional to invite the influence of the Holy Ghost. You could invite a young woman in your class to share an experience, bear testimony, or lead a discussion about a doctrine before the activity begins. For some of the following suggested activities, each young woman will need to have access to a bicycle.</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<strong>Introduction to cycling.</strong> Invite an expert from your Church unit or community to use pictures, videos, and stories to introduce cycling to the young women. Research and explore nearby areas and trails where you could practice cycling.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Clothing and technique.</strong> Learn about suitable clothing to wear when cycling, such as brightly colored, reflective clothing. In low-light conditions, use lights on the front and back of your bike to make you visible from all directions. Invite an expert to teach the young women about good cycling posture and how to shift gears. Practice what you learn.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Bicycle maintenance.</strong> Invite an expert to teach you how to maintain a bicycle, including cleaning the bike chain, checking brakes, patching and repairing tires, and so on. Make sure each young woman has an opportunity to practice bicycle maintenance.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Hand signals and communication.</strong> Learn cycling hand signals and vocal commands that will help you communicate with other vehicles on the road. Always ride in the direction of traffic and stay on the side of the road.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>First aid and safety precautions.</strong> Ask an experienced cyclist to teach you about the common dangers of cycling and how to stay safe. Always wear a helmet while cycling. You should also learn the rules for cycling in your country and community. Practice first aid skills for cycling injuries.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Personal fitness program.</strong> Develop and implement a personal fitness program as a Young Women class. This program should take a number of weeks and help each young woman prepare for the cycling trip.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Practice bicycle ride and conditioning.</strong> Go on a ride together, and practice what you have learned about cycling—posture, braking, shifting gears, hand signals, and being safe. You could choose a local bicycle route that you and the other young women can ride in less than two hours. Enjoy the bicycle ride together, and make sure nobody is left behind.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cycling routes and navigation.</strong> As a class, learn how to read and understand a topographic map. Study the cycling routes available near you and plan a trip on one of those routes.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Trip planning and preparation.</strong> With your adult leaders, plan the details and timing of your one- or two-day cycling trip. Be sure to make plans for food, transportation, safety, shelter, and equipment. Communicate with your parents about your plans and schedule. Enjoy a safe trip with the young women in your class, and use the skills you have learned. Plan for a longer devotional that will strengthen the testimonies of your Young Women class.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan an activity where you invite someone with first aid experience to teach you the basic steps in emergency response and first aid. Learn how to respond to specific emergencies that could take place in your area. Make a list of possible emergencies—such as a car accident, animal attack, severe fall, or fire—and practice emergency response and first aid for each one. Following are eight steps commonly used in emergency response that you could practice during your activity.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As part of your activity, make laminated copies of these steps to keep in your first aid kit so that you can continue to review them and be prepared to help in an emergency.</p>
					<ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="number-list" compact="none">
						<li>
							<strong>Check the scene.</strong> Stay calm. Establish control and identify the emergency. Before you act, stop and look over the whole scene. Take steps to protect yourself from any diseases that could be transmitted. Ask yourself these questions: Are there dangers in the area? How many people are injured? Are there other people nearby who can assist me? How can I help others stay safe? Is it safe for me to assist?</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Call for help.</strong> Specifically assign someone to call for help, or send two people to get help. If you are the one reporting the emergency, be sure to give the most accurate location and directions possible and provide as much information as possible about the extent of the injuries victims may have. Wait for any questions and obey all instructions from emergency personnel. Write down any information you receive from them.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Approach the site carefully.</strong> Keep your own safety in mind. In order to be able to help someone else, you must remain safe yourself. Be aware of possible dangers, and protect yourself from exposure to blood.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Treat life-threatening cases first.</strong> Immediately treat the cases where someone’s life is threatened, such as when a victim has stopped breathing, has no heartbeat, is bleeding severely, has been poisoned, or is choking.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Protect from further injury.</strong> Assess your surroundings. If the victim is in immediate danger, move him or her immediately. However, moving someone who has been injured can be dangerous and could increase the severity of his or her injuries. Move victims very carefully and only when necessary.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Recognize signs and treat victims for shock.</strong> Check for signs of shock in the victim, including a fast pulse, mental confusion, decreased blood pressure, and fast breathing. Shock is life threatening. Every victim should be treated for shock immediately, even if you don’t recognize the signs at first. Shock treatment usually involves helping the victim lie down, treating obvious injuries, and keeping the victim warm.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Treat other injuries.</strong> Check the victim for other injuries. If the he or she is mentally alert, you may ask him or her to identify parts of the body that hurt or check mobility in arms and legs. Pay as much attention to how well a victim responds as to what he or she says.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Make a plan and reassess.</strong> Check the victim’s condition every 5 to 15 minutes. Watch for any changes. Contact and inform emergency personnel of any changes.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to survive a disaster, you must prepare essential items and develop the attitude that you can cope with and overcome problems. Plan a series of activities that will help you gain the skills you need to survive and serve others during a disaster. You may want to invite someone with knowledge or experience to help you with these activities. You could also plan a culminating activity, such as a mock disaster or survival camp. The following are some ideas for activities that may help you learn emergency survival skills:</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<strong>First aid.</strong> Learn how to provide the type of first aid required during various disasters, such as a flood, fire, or earthquake.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Natural disasters.</strong> Invite someone with knowledge or experience to teach the young women about the disasters that are common to your community. Make a plan to prepare for and respond to those types of disasters. Create or update your 72-hour kit and keep it in a safe place that would likely be accessible during an emergency.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Make a plan.</strong> Imagine that a natural disaster has occurred in your area. Make a plan to respond by asking the following questions: How do I communicate with my family, including those family members who live far away? Where do I go if my home is destroyed? What is my family’s designated meeting place? What food and water will I have?</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Purify water.</strong> Learn how to find and purify water using boiling, chlorine bleach, iodine tablets, and filters. Create an emergency kit that includes a way to purify water.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Food storage.</strong> Explore ways to store food for long periods of time. You could explore some of the resources and information on <a href="http://www.providentliving.org">providentliving.org</a>.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Meals.</strong> Cook a meal using food that has been stored for a while. Use only the cooking utensils and appliances that would be available to you in a disaster.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Emergency shelters.</strong> Learn how to build a shelter during an emergency. Make sure you learn about A-frame tents, lean-tos, and snow caves. Build a shelter out of the type of materials that would be available to you during a disaster. Sleep in your shelter overnight.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Service project.</strong> Take a short trip to an area that recently experienced a disaster. Clean up the area and provide service. Write in your journal about what you see and learn from this experience. Before you go, take time to review the “<a href="/topics/emergency-preparedness/guidelines-for-disaster-cleanup-and-church-volunteer-safety">Disaster Cleanup Guidelines and Church Volunteer Safety</a>.”</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Campout.</strong> Plan and attend a survival campout where you put your emergency skills to use.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Preparedness workshop.</strong> Organize a disaster preparedness workshop for your community or Church unit.</li>

If you are participating in an outdoor camp, these evening programs could occur around the campfire and could involve cooking a simple treat or meal over the fire (be sure to extinguish the fire completely when you’re finished). These programs should involve all the young women, either individually, in small groups, or as one large group. You could sing songs, play group games, share a spiritual thought, or discuss uplifting experiences from that day at camp. You may also want to invite speakers—such as the Young Women president, an adult camp leader, or the patriarch in your area—to speak on the camp theme. The young women could also use this time to develop their talents by playing musical instruments, storytelling, singing, dancing, or participating in a dramatization.</p>

						<li>Donate the food that your garden produces to families in need in your community.</li>
						<li>Learn how to preserve fruits and vegetables by drying or canning them. You could purchase or borrow the necessary canning materials, such as a large pot and glass jars with sealing lids.</li>
						<li>Learn how to take care of chickens or other small animals, such as rabbits, that can be used for meat. If your family or someone in your area has these animals, volunteer to help care for them.</li>
						<li>Plan a service project at a local farm, nursery, or botanical garden.</li>
						<li>Hold a food drive for needy individuals or families in your area.</li>
						<li>Help elderly people or families in need to take care of their yard or garden.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan a series of activities over a period of three to six months to help the young women learn the habits of a healthy lifestyle. Consider inviting someone with knowledge and experience from your branch, ward, or community to help you with some of these activities. You could plan a final activity at Young Women camp that includes planning and preparing nutritious meals and participating in strenuous exercise. Your final activity could also be outside Young Women camp, such as participating in a race or triathlon.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following are some ideas for activities that can help you develop these healthy habits.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<em>General health:</em>
					</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Learn about the elements of good health. Develop a plan as a class to establish good habits and maintain or improve your health.</li>
						<li>For 12 weeks, keep track of and limit the amount of time you spend playing video, phone, or computer games or watching TV or movies.</li>
						<li>Invite a medical professional or knowledgeable consultant to teach the young women about the benefits of sleep. If necessary, help the young women make plans to get enough sleep.</li>
						<li>Plan, organize, and lead a healthy living challenge for your Young Women class. This challenge could include eating nutritious meals or improving physical skills.</li>
					</ul>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the help of your adult leaders, plan a hike (or a walk, run, or similar activity) that will help the young women to appreciate their surroundings, accomplish something difficult, and develop friendships. Plan your hike to include rest periods so you can enjoy singing songs, telling stories, writing in your journal, sketching, or observing nature. The following guidelines can be applied both to hiking and to other similar outdoor activities.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<em>Preparation</em>
					</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan a hike that accommodates the skills and fitness levels of the young women in your class. Consider the following supply list as you plan:</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Appropriate footwear</li>
						<li>Water bottle</li>
						<li>Food or snacks</li>
						<li>Waterproof clothing for inclement weather</li>
						<li>Sunscreen and hat</li>
						<li>Journal and pen</li>
						<li>Map and compass</li>
						<li>Coat or sweatshirt for cold weather</li>
						<li>Mylar blanket</li>
						<li>Insect repellent</li>
						<li>Flashlight and batteries</li>
						<li>Matches and fire starter</li>
						<li>Whistle and small mirror</li>
						<li>Personal first aid kit</li>
						<li>Pocketknife</li>
					</ul>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carry essential supplies in a backpack or secure bag. Keep your hands and arms free so that you can catch yourself if you trip.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<em>Safety</em>
					</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Help the young women understand and follow these safety guidelines:</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Avoid hazards such as electrical storms, loose rocks, dirt slides, cliffs, swamps, and dangerous plants and animals. Take the necessary precautions for your area.</li>
						<li>Make sure each young woman has a hiking partner who can help her stay safe and get help in case of injury. Keep pace with one another. Establish a calling signal that you can use if you become separated or in case of an emergency.</li>
						<li>Plan for an adequate number of adult leaders to help the group reach the destination safely. These leaders should be familiar with the trail and its dangers.</li>
						<li>Keep to the established trails, if possible. Track reference points to chart your progress, and make a backup plan for emergencies.</li>
						<li>When walking on a busy road, stay with your group, keep out of the way of traffic, and walk single file against the direction of traffic. Wear reflective clothing when you’re walking on a road at night.</li>
						<li>Avoid heat exhaustion or dehydration by bringing enough water for your hike. Never drink water that has been unfiltered or untreated. You may want to bring a way to filter or treat water for your hike. If you’re overheated, drink only small sips of water at a time.</li>
						<li>Respect the property of others.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan an activity where you learn how to use a knife safely. You could invite someone with knowledge and experience to teach you how to whittle or carve. You could also learn and practice how to throw knives if you have the knives that are specifically designed for throwing. Throughout the activity, make sure you use proper safety techniques. Care for and sharpen your knife after the activity is over. Find ways to use your knife during camp, such as preparing tinder for the campfire. Be sure to obey the following guidelines during your activity.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<strong>Knife safety:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Never pass a knife to someone when the blade is exposed. Close or sheath the knife beforehand. Always pass the knife handle first.</li>
						<li>Cut away from yourself. If the blade slips, it will not cut you.</li>
						<li>Never leave your knife on the ground.</li>
						<li>Always store your knife sheathed and in a safe place, away from the reach of children.</li>
						<li>Never walk with your knife in hand, and be aware of your surroundings when you are working with a knife.</li>
					</ul>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<strong>Caring for your knife:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Keep your knife clean, dry, sharp, and free from rust.</li>
						<li>Apply a few drops of light machine oil to the knife joints and blade.</li>
						<li>Never try to cut materials such as metal, brick, and similar hard surfaces. These materials will ruin your blade. Make sure wood is free from nails before you start cutting or carving.</li>
						<li>Do not put pressure on the broad side of the blade or use the blade to pry something open because the blade may break.</li>
						<li>Keep your knife away from fire. Heat will temper the steel, making the knife soft and difficult to sharpen.</li>
					</ul>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<strong>Sharpening your knife:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Gather your materials, such as a whetstone and machine oil.</li>
						<li>Place a few drops of light machine oil on the rough side of the whetstone. The oil makes any loosened metal float and prevents it from glazing the stone surface.</li>
						<li>Hold the blade flat on the stone surface (use the rough stone surface when your knife needs a lot of sharpening and the fine surface when it needs only a little sharpening). Raise the back of the blade slightly and stroke the full edge of the blade across the stone. Use a smooth and circular slicing motion, as if you were cutting a thin slice off the stone.</li>
						<li>Turn the blade over, and use the same process to sharpen the other side of the blade.</li>
						<li>Continue this process until the blade is sharp. Test the knife on a dry twig or small branch.</li>

							<strong>Maps.</strong> Learn the different types of maps that will be useful to you, including basic road maps and topographical, aeronautical, and geological survey maps. Take special note of when the map was printed and note any landmarks that are missing. Make sure that the map has enough detail to guide you on a trail.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>GPS.</strong> Invite an expert to teach you how to use GPS, including marking way points, making track logs, and backtracking. Learn how to find coordinates on a map and how to navigate to a marked point. Make sure you know how to enter GPS coordinates for longitude and latitude.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Geocaching.</strong> Practice your orienteering skills by searching for geocaches in your area. Geocaching is when an individual or group uses a GPS-enabled device (such as a smartphone) to locate a geocache, or container, hidden in an area. There are thousands of geocaches in cities, towns, and forests across the world, and you can find lists of local geocaches by searching online. In order to go geocaching, you will need to obtain coordinates for a nearby geocache and find it using GPS.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan a series of activities that will help you learn how to cook outdoors using various techniques, such as are listed in this activity. You may want to invite someone with knowledge and experience in your Church unit or community to help you plan these activities. Plan a final activity such as an overnight campout, where you can practice the skills you’ve learned. Following are different types of outdoor cooking that you could try.</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<strong>Dutch oven cooking.</strong> Dutch ovens are large cast-iron pots with close, tight lids. They are used for roasting, stewing, or baking. To cook in a Dutch oven, build a crisscross fire and allow it to burn until it creates a deep bed of coals. For easier cleanup, line the pot with foil if you are baking biscuits or a cake. Place your food inside the pot, and close the lid. Place the pot on top of the coals, and use a shovel to scoop some coals onto the lid. In place of a traditional fire, you could also use charcoal in your Dutch oven cooking.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Pit cooking.</strong> To cook in a pit, tightly wrap a simple meal, such as seasoned vegetables, in foil. Then dig a pit that is about one square foot deep. Line the bottom of the pit with flat rocks (avoid any rocks that contain limestone, shale, or moisture because they may explode). Build a teepee fire on top of the rocks. Then build a crisscross fire on top of the teepee fire. Keep this fire going for about an hour until the rocks are white with heat. Scoop out the coals from the fire, and place your foil dinner on the rocks. Sprinkle some of the coals on top of the foil dinner. Fill in the pit with dirt, and let the food cook. After about 45 minutes, dig out the hot food and refill the pit with dirt.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Reflector oven.</strong> Reflector ovens use flames from a fire, not coals, to cook food such as bread, casseroles, and pizza. You can regulate the oven temperature by moving the food closer to or farther from the fire. To make a reflector oven, you will need a five- or ten-gallon can, a metal rack or shelf, tin snips, and wire. Using tin snips, cut one side of the can open, and use wire to mount and secure the shelf or rack in the middle of the can. Cook by placing your food on the shelf and bringing the oven close to an open fire.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Stone fireplace.</strong> To create a stone fireplace, place two large, flat rocks on either side of a fire, close enough to each other so that they can hold a skillet or pot with your food. Using this method, you can make eggs, bacon, pancakes, and many other meals.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Trench fire.</strong> Trench fires are good for cooking with pots and skillets. Place two large logs parallel to each other. Then build a small fire between the logs. Balance the skillet on the large logs, over the fire. If you want to create a grill, you can notch the logs and lay metal rods from one log to another. For slower cooking, bring the logs together at one end. Be sure to completely extinguish the fire when you are finished.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Spit cooking.</strong> Spit cooking is useful for fowl, fish, or kebobs. Build a low teepee fire. On either side of the fire, place two notched sticks upright in the ground. Then make a spit out of green wood and soak it with water so it does not burn. Put the spit through the meat or food you want to cook and place it over the fire. Baste and turn the food often.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cooking without utensils.</strong> You may also want to learn to cook without pots or utensils. To do this, you could use green wood, rocks, and coals.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<strong>Parents’ station:</strong> Have a station or booth where the parents of the young women can learn about the schedule, activities, and purpose of Young Women camp. Give them the chance to fill out and sign the appropriate registration and medical forms. Let the parents know beforehand what information (such as immunization dates and records) they will need to complete these forms.</p>

						<strong>Young women and youth camp leaders’ station:</strong> Plan for a station or booth where the young women and youth camp leaders gather to discuss assignments, plan meals, delegate responsibilities, and gain skills. You could memorize the camp theme, learn songs, or play team-building games. If your camp will include outdoor, physical activities, you may want to put together a physical fitness plan that will help each young woman prepare to enjoy these activities. You could also use this time to prepare equipment that you will use at camp, such as a mess kit.</p>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although not every Young Women camp will be held in an outdoor, natural setting, all young women should learn how to protect, preserve, and restore natural environments (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.13">D&amp;C 104:13</a>). Following are some principles and activity ideas that will help you learn how to take care of our natural world.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<strong>Protect the environment</strong>
					</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<em>Go on a hike.</em> Use only the trails that already exist, and walk in the middle of the trail. Do not touch or take any artifacts or plants. If you see any wildlife, keep a safe distance and do not try to feed them. Never leave trash or food on the trail.</li>
						<li>
							<em>Participate in an overnight camp.</em> Use only the campsites that already exist, and do not alter the site. Camp on durable surfaces, such as packed dirt or rock, and make sure your site is at least 200 feet (61 m) away from any lakes, rivers, or streams to avoid contaminating water resources. Store food and trash properly in sealed containers to avoid attracting animals to your campsite (see the activity on basic sanitation).</li>
					</ul>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<strong>Preserve and restore the environment</strong>
					</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<em>Clean up a local natural resource.</em> Find a natural resource near where you live, and plan a service project to pick up all the trash or debris in the area. Use this activity to explore the correct ways to dispose of garbage, such as burning, burying, or removing. You may need to ask local authorities to teach you about the disposal methods that are proper for your area. Never leave any trash, food, or litter on the ground. Bury all human waste in holes at least 6 inches (15 cm) deep and 200 feet (61 m) away from water, campsites, and trails.</li>
						<li>
							<em>Teach others how to take care of the environment.</em> Invite friends to come camping with you. Show courtesy to others in your area by regulating how much noise you make.</li>
						<li>
							<em>Trail maintenance.</em> Plan an activity to help rebuild, mark, or establish a nearby trail.</li>
						<li>
							<em>Purify a local water resource.</em> Invite someone with knowledge and experience to teach you about the problems with water pollution in your area. Go to a local water resource and help clean out trash. Practice clean water skills, and do your part to prevent water pollution.</li>
						<li>
							<em>Plant trees.</em> Learn about the problems with air pollution and erosion in your area. Find an area and plant some trees to help decrease air pollution and erosion.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organize a series of activities to prepare for a one- or two-day rafting trip. These activities could take place over a period of weeks or months. To ensure safety, many of the following activity ideas require the presence of a certified river rafting specialist. For each activity, include a spiritual moment—such as a devotional—to invite the influence of the Holy Ghost. Following are some ideas for activities that will help you learn about river rafting:</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<strong>Introduction to river rafting.</strong> Invite an expert from your Church unit or community to use pictures, stories, and videos to teach you about river rafting. Learn about the equipment you need to make rafting safe. You could also use a map of your area to become familiar with places where you could practice rafting.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Learn about rivers.</strong> River rafting will require you to know how to read river currents and features in order to stay safe. Become familiar with the classification system for rivers and other bodies of water and the ratings for rivers near where you live.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>River safety and swim test.</strong> Invite an expert to teach you about the hazards of river rafting and how to remain safe. Learn the techniques for how to guide a raft down a river or through a body of water. Practice how to communicate with each other when rafting. Practice swimming with the young women in your class and improve your swimming skills with appropriate exercise. When in a raft or swimming in a river, always wear a personal flotation device.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Practice mild rafting.</strong> Practice some of the rafting skills, such as navigation and communication, in a safe setting, such as a nearby pool or lake.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cookout.</strong> Learn how to transport and keep food dry on a rafting trip. Practice preparing food for your trip using outdoor cooking methods.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Maps and navigation.</strong> Ask an expert to teach you how to use a map and compass to navigate a river. Practice these skills.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>First aid.</strong> Invite an expert to teach you basic first aid for injuries that are common to rafting. Do your best to master these first aid skills, and make sure that you bring first aid supplies on your trip.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Practice with rapids.</strong> Use your skills to practice paddling, navigating, and rafting in rougher waters with some rapids. Make sure you have the help of a certified river guide or an expert from your Church unit or community to help you.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Trip planning and preparation.</strong> Plan and prepare for a short rafting trip. Be sure to make plans for food, transportation, safety, shelter, equipment. Make sure that a certified guide also helps you plan the trip.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>River rafting trip.</strong> Enjoy a safe trip with the other young women, using the skills you have learned. Plan a longer devotional that helps you make connections between the gospel and what you have learned while preparing for the rafting trip.</li>
					</ul>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<strong>River Safety</strong>
					</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of the type of boat you’re using, you need to be aware of some safety rules. Always follow the instructions from your professional guide. Keep your legs inside the boat. Following are some safety rules for rivers and other bodies of water, in case you’re thrown from your boat.</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>Check to see if you’re close enough to swim back to the boat quickly so that you can get pulled back in. If you’re separated from the boat by whitewater or rapids, you may need to float downstream for a period of time.</li>
						<li>Float on your back with your feet pointed downstream. This will allow you to push off rocks with your feet instead of hitting your head. Never lock your knees when you’re floating.</li>
						<li>Avoid being swept under a log or bramble. If you see one ahead of you, flip onto your stomach and swim hard to get on top of the obstacle. If you go under, you could get stuck underwater.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organize a series of activities that will help you learn about and gain experience rock climbing and rappelling. Many of the following activity ideas require a certified specialist from your Church unit or community to make sure everyone is safe. For each activity, include a devotional to invite the influence of the Holy Ghost. You may want to plan a final activity to practice what you have learned. Each young woman will need access to climbing gear for some of the following activities.</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="list-decor">
						<li>
							<strong>Introduction to rock climbing and rappelling.</strong> Invite a trained and qualified expert from your Church unit or community to use pictures, stories, and videos to introduce you to rock climbing and rappelling. Find nearby areas or gyms where you can climb.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Safety commands, gear, and hardware.</strong> Invite a certified expert to teach you general safety practices such as double-checking knots and wearing the right gear. Learn and practice safety commands for rock climbing and belaying. Make sure you understand what gear—harnesses, helmets, gloves, climbing shoes, and so forth—is required for each activity.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Knots and essential rope care.</strong> Learn some basic knots that can be used in climbing, such as daisy chains and water knots. Learn how to set anchors on bolts and around trees, rocks, and bushes. Never step on a rope. You should also learn the different ways to coil and care for ropes and check them for weaknesses and wear.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Rappelling and belay devices.</strong> Under the guidance of a certified expert, take a short trip to a location in your area where you can learn rappelling.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Ascending a rope.</strong> Invite a certified expert to teach you how to use weighted knots and a harness to ascend a rope.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Advanced rappelling.</strong> Under the guidance of a certified consultant, choose a location where you and the other young women in your class can learn to rappel from a greater height. Make sure everyone understands that rappelling includes checking the safety of any existing anchors, blocks, and gear. Be sure to take all your trash and gear with you when you leave, and avoid disturbing the natural landscape.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>First aid certification.</strong> Learn and practice basic first aid that includes treating common climbing injuries, such as cuts, rope burns, and open calluses. If you will be climbing or rappelling more than 30 to 60 minutes away from a trailhead, at least one person should be trained in wilderness first aid (see the activity on basic first aid).</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Rock climbing.</strong> Find a place near where you live to rock climb as a Young Women class. Make sure you have a certified specialist with you. If you are at a climbing gym, employees often serve as climbing specialists. Learn about and practice using the gear. If possible, practice a variety of climbs and skills.</li>

							<strong>Lean-to.</strong> To make a lean-to, tie a tarp to a pole or rope that is parallel to the ground and has been lashed to two upright sticks or poles. Use ropes and pegs to hold the upright poles in place. Anchor the tarp to the ground with rocks. You can also make a lean-to by tying two corners of a tarp to the branches of two trees. Use pegs or rocks to anchor the other side of the tarp to the ground. If no tarp is available for the lean-to, you could tie branches or palm fronds to the pole or trees and pile dirt on top of the branches or palm fronds to provide more insulation, but do not gather this material from live trees.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Other emergency shelters.</strong> You can also create a waterproof lining in a snow cave or line a rock cave with fallen leaves and branches to use as an emergency shelter.</li>

If you are navigating in open water—without landmarks—you will also need to learn how to plot courses using latitude and longitude. Plan a series of activities over a number of weeks to help you learn about water navigation. After you finish, you may want to plan a final activity—such as a river rafting or sailing trip. For these activities, you will need access to watercraft—rafts, canoes, kayaks, sailboats, or motorboats.</p>
					<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
						<li>
							<strong>Types of watercraft.</strong> Learn about different types of watercraft, and learn how to use one type. Invite an expert to teach you how to plot courses using latitude and longitude.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Astronomy and meteorology.</strong> Learn how to navigate using astronomy. Make sure you know how to use constellations, the sun, or the moon to find your way. Also learn how to recognize different types of clouds, such as cumulus, cirrus, cirrocumulus, stratus, nimbus, and cumulonimbus.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Safety and gear.</strong> Invite an expert to teach you about the gear required for your chosen type of watercraft. Learn how to tie the knots related to your watercraft. Make sure you understand safety commands. Always wear a personal flotation device when you’re in a boat, and make sure that your watercraft meets all the requirements of your government.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>First aid and emergency preparedness.</strong> Learn first aid for injuries related to water recreation. Also learn how to avoid accidents, what to do during severe weather such as thunder and lightning storms, and how to respond to an emergency situation while on the water. Learn how to waterproof items such as food and matches.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Physical conditioning.</strong> With the other young women in your class, practice and improve your ability to swim. You may want to practice cold water swimming and swimming in choppy waters. You could make a plan as a Young Women class to improve your swimming skills so that you can swim for a longer distance, such as one mile (1.6 km). Learn what to do if your watercraft turns over or if you get thrown into the water.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Plan a trip.</strong> Choose a nearby lake, river, or ocean. Plan and go on a trip that will last a few days and put your water navigation skills to use. Make sure your plans include preparation for water safety, different weather conditions, charting your course, the type of watercraft you will use, shelter, and food. Create a packing list. Also prepare for devotionals, personal reflections, group prayers, and scripture reading.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Water conservation.</strong> Invite an expert to teach you how to protect water resources from pollution and conserve water during a drought. Begin to build up your supply of water in the case of an emergency.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Service project.</strong> Clean up an area with a water resource. Learn about the dangers of water pollution in your area.</li>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Provide groups of youth with a list of possible service projects, and assign point values to each one. Assign each group (accompanied by an adult leader) to visit nearby homes, streets, or neighborhoods to see how many service projects they can accomplish in that area in a set amount of time. For example, they could clean up litter on a street or offer to pull someone’s weeds. Have all the groups return at the end to add up their points and share their experiences. You could also award extra points for youth who perform service that is not on the list.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the activity, consider having a short discussion led by youth who are leaders in their quorums or classes. Consider discussing questions like: How did you feel while serving? How were others affected through your service? What is our responsibility to others in our community? Why do we serve? (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17">Mosiah 2:17</a>.)</p>

					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Young men and young women ages 14 to 18 are invited to participate together in an activity or series of activities called youth conference. Youth conferences are usually held once each year on a ward or stake level. They may also be held on a multistake or area level. Stake youth conferences are planned and carried out by the stake Aaronic Priesthood–Young Women committee under the direction of the stake presidency. Youth should be invited to assist the committee as much as possible in planning stake youth conferences. The stake presidency may invite youth to attend the committee’s meetings as needed.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Select a gospel theme for the conference. It could be a scripture, the Mutual theme for the year, or a quotation from a living prophet. The stake presidency should approve the theme. Plan activities such as devotionals, group meetings, learning experiences, and service projects that are consistent with the theme.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Members of the bishopric or stake presidency are invited to attend as much of the conference as possible. Young Men and Young Women presidencies are encouraged to attend the entire conference.</p>
					<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For policies related to youth conferences, see <em>Handbook 2: Administering the Church</em> (2010), 13.4.</p>
