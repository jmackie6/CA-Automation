Right now I have a bearded dragon, a corn snake, a king snake named Elvis, and lots of mice. My big brother, Tim, is at the MTC getting ready to go to Portugal. Sometimes I send him a letter with a snakeskin in it so that he can see how much Elvis is growing.</para>
					<para paraID="3">One day when I was feeding Elvis he got loose because I wasn’t watching him carefully. My mom and I closed the door to my room right away and started looking for him. We couldn’t find Elvis no matter how hard we looked. I got the idea to pray. Even though it was my fault for letting him get out, I knew that Heavenly Father could help me find him. I prayed every day, but I also kept looking in my room. I kept my door closed and put a towel in front of it.</para>
					<para paraID="4">After two weeks I still hadn’t found Elvis. He had to be getting very hungry. I knew that if I kept praying I would find him. I just wanted to find him while he was still alive. Finally my prayers were answered as I heard all three of my sisters screaming. Elvis wasn’t in my room after all. He was in one of my sisters’ rooms. My mom helped me catch him and put him back in his cage. I was so happy that I found him. I know that Heavenly Father answers our prayers even if sometimes it takes a long time.<br/>Matthew J., age 9, Virginia</para>

			<para paraID="8">Several years ago, the Salt Lake City newspapers published a notice of a close friend taken by death in the prime of her life. I visited the mortuary and joined a host of persons gathered to express condolence [sympathy] to the husband and motherless children. Suddenly the smallest child, Kelly, recognized me and took my hand in hers. “Come with me,” she said, and she led me to the casket in which rested the body of her beloved mother. “I’m not crying,” she said, “and neither must you. Many times my mommy told me about death and life with Heavenly Father. I belong to my mommy and my daddy. We’ll all be together again.” To my mind came the words of the Psalmist: “Out of the mouth of babes … hast thou ordained strength” (<scriptureRef book="ps" chapter="8" verse="2">Psalm 8:2</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="9">Through tear-moistened eyes, I saw my young friend’s beautiful and faith-filled smile. For her, whose tiny hand yet clasped mine, there would never be a hopeless dawn. Sustained by her unfailing testimony, knowing that life continues beyond the grave, she, her father, her brothers, her sisters, and indeed all who share this knowledge of divine truth can declare to the world: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning” (<scriptureRef book="ps" chapter="30" verse="5">Psalm 30:5</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="10">With all the strength of my soul, I testify that God lives, that His Beloved Son is the firstfruits of the Resurrection, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is that penetrating light that makes of every hopeless dawn a joyful morning.</para>

			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="4"/>“Look!” Mom whispered excitedly as she pointed to the crown flower. At first I could only see the flower and wide leaves. Then I saw them—not just one, but two caterpillars with black, white, and yellow stripes.</para>
			<para paraID="6">I jumped up and down and shouted, “We found some! We found some! Dad, come quick!” Mom and I had been searching for this kind of caterpillar for months. On the mainland they are called monarch caterpillars, but here in Hawaii we call them <emphasis>pulelehua</emphasis> caterpillars. I had read all about them in books from the library, but I’d never seen a real one.</para>
			<para paraID="7">Mom carefully broke off the branch, and I picked some extra leaves for food. I helped Dad punch some holes in the lid of a big plastic jar. Then Mom and I gently put the caterpillars in their new home.</para>
			<para paraID="8">I watched the caterpillars until it was bedtime. I wanted to sleep by them, but Mom said <pageBreak pageNum="5"/>it would be best to leave them outside. After I said my prayers, Dad tucked me into bed. Then I asked him, “Are you sure those caterpillars are going to turn into butterflies?” He told me that they would after they wrapped themselves in chrysalises.</para>
			<para paraID="9">The next morning I woke up early and ran to check on my caterpillars. They were still there, munching on the leaves. During the next week I gave them more leaves and watched them eat and eat. They got fatter and fatter. Then one morning I noticed that they were hanging upside down. When I came home for lunch, my caterpillars were gone!</para>
			<para paraID="10">“Mom! Somebody stole my caterpillars!” I yelled. Mom laughed as she took the lid off the jar and showed me the bright green chrysalises hanging where the caterpillars had been.</para>
			<para paraID="11">“Now will they turn into butterflies?” I asked.</para>
			<para paraID="12">“They will when the time is right,” Mom said.</para>
			<para paraID="13">Over the next week we watched the chrysalises slowly change. A tiny gold stripe appeared near the top, and the green got darker and darker until it was almost black. Then one day after I had almost forgotten about them, one of the butterflies hatched and flew away. Mom said I should be happy. But I was frustrated because I had missed seeing it hatch. When Dad reminded me that I still had one more, I felt better.</para>
			<para paraID="14">This time I was going to make sure I didn’t miss it. Everywhere I went the chrysalis came with me. We even took the jar with us on our vacation, but still no butterfly.</para>
			<para paraID="15">When Sunday came, I wanted to take the jar to church. Mom said she <pageBreak pageNum="6"/>could use the chrysalis to help with sharing time.</para>
			<para paraID="16">During sharing time Mom taught us that all things testify of Jesus Christ. Then she held up my jar and showed the children the two chrysalises. We talked about how a caterpillar changes into a butterfly and leaves behind an empty chrysalis. Mom told us that the new life of a butterfly can remind us of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Then she sang, “‘How could the Father tell the world of sacrifice, of death? He sent his Son to die for us and rise with living breath.’”<popMarker popRef="002">*</popMarker> Mom smiled and said, “Maybe if we all sing this song and think about the words, we can sing the butterfly right out of its chrysalis!”</para>
			<para paraID="17">We all sat up straight in our seats and sang our very best. When the song ended, everyone was very quiet. Suddenly one of the children said, “Look!”</para>
			<para paraID="18">We all looked at the jar on the table, and there was a butterfly unfolding its wings. My mom’s mouth opened wide, but she didn’t make a sound. Sister Makuakane whispered, “It’s a miracle!” All the children were excited to see the butterfly opening and closing its big orange and black wings. No one could stop smiling.</para>
			<para paraID="19">After church we set the butterfly free. We watched as it danced away in the wind. I have seen a lot of butterflies since then, but none of them were as beautiful as our sharing time butterfly.</para>

			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="8"/>My mother is a very special woman. I am the oldest of eight sons, and I also have seven sisters. With such a large family, my mother had great responsibilities. The best thing my mother did for us was to be baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She gave us the opportunity to learn about the gospel. This opportunity changed our lives.</para>
			<para paraID="6">I remember the day we received the missionaries. I was about 10 or 11 years old. The missionaries shared a message about the First Vision. As soon as my mother listened, she was converted. She believed Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son.</para>
			<para paraID="7">We began to attend church. I didn’t want to accept the gospel at first, but the missionaries persuaded me to see what it was all about. As soon as I did, I loved it. I am so grateful for my mother. She received a testimony during that first visit of the missionaries. From her baptism until today, she never missed a Church meeting.</para>
			<para paraID="8">My mother was a tremendous support to us. She always cleaned our white shirts on Saturdays so they would be ready to wear on Sundays. We would polish our shoes <pageBreak pageNum="9"/>and the shoes of our youngest brothers and sisters. We lived in a poor neighborhood in Guatemala, and our neighbors would laugh at us on Sundays as we wore our white shirts and ties to church.</para>
			<para paraID="9">My mother always gave us courage to do the right. Because of her influence, we were very active in the Church. I remember that at one time, my father served as the Sunday School president, my older sister served as the Primary president, my mother served as the Relief Society president, and four of my brothers passed, prepared, and blessed the sacrament.</para>
			<para paraID="10">Because of our financial needs, my father expected me to help earn money for the family. I wanted to serve a mission, but when I turned 19 years old, he asked that I wait one year to serve my mission so I could continue working to help my family. When I turned 20 years old, he asked that I wait another year to serve.</para>
			<para paraID="11">Just before I turned 21 years old, he wanted to request that I wait one more year. But my mother told him, “Let him go serve, and it will bless us.” This really happened. Before my mission, only a younger brother and I had worked to help support the family. As soon as I went on my mission, two more of my brothers and my two oldest sisters started working, so my family did better financially.</para>
			<para paraID="12">Every blessing and call that I have received in the Church have led me to admire my mother more. In every part of my life, I remember her excellent influence and example. My mother had only a basic education, but her knowledge of the truths of the gospel and her practical knowledge and understanding of life were superior.</para>
			<para paraID="13">My childhood was happy because I always had my mother at home taking care of me. She had a great sense of humor, and she would always find ways to have fun. She took hours and hours to share with us stories about her childhood and about my grandma and aunts and uncles and her relationship with them.</para>
			<para paraID="14">I believe in the commandment to honor our parents. Everything I do, even today, is because of the influence of my mother.</para>

			<para paraID="6"><pageBreak pageNum="11"/>“This will be the 10th load of hay,” David’s father called to him. “Drive over to the higher ground.” Young David O. McKay looked across the field to where his father was pointing. The first nine loads they had gathered were full of lesser-quality hay. David knew his father meant for this 10th load of the best hay to go to the bishops’ storehouse as their tithing. But he didn’t understand why they couldn’t give the Lord the same hay they were collecting.</para>
			<para paraID="7">David called back to his father, “No, let us take the hay as it comes.”</para>
			<para paraID="8">David’s father didn’t answer. David was about to repeat himself when he saw his father turn and begin walking straight toward him. Suddenly, the breeze in the hay field was gone, and the sun became feverishly hot. David wiped the sweat from his forehead and the back of his neck. He knew his father was not crossing the field to give him a pat on the back for his snippy answer. He was coming all this way to be sure that David understood something.</para>
			<para paraID="9">“No, David.” His father spoke sternly, yet the calm in his voice made David pay extra close attention. “This is the 10th load, and the best is none too good for God.” David’s father looked closely at his son’s face to make sure he had been listening. Then he turned and walked away.</para>
			<para paraID="10">David swallowed the lump in his throat and then guided his team to the higher ground. As he loaded the cut hay onto the wagon, he began to think of what his father was trying to teach him. While he knew that tithing is a law, just as much as obedience and sacrifice are, David wanted to put their own needs first. But God had said to take the firstlings of the flocks—the very best—and give them to Him (see <scriptureRef book="deut" chapter="12" verse="6">Deuteronomy 12:6</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="11">“My father gives the best to God, and we get the next best,” David thought. “Perhaps this is how we make the Lord the center of our thoughts and our lives.”</para>
			<para paraID="12">There were times when David had watched his mother pay money for tithing. Instead of spending what she needed and then hoping there was some left for tithing, she immediately sent the tithing money to the bishop and then made do with what was left. The first and the best was always given to God.</para>
			<para paraID="13">David turned the hay wagon down the dusty road toward the bishops’ storehouse. He drove into the yard and unloaded the hay. It was a sacrifice for his father to give his best hay to the Lord, but David knew his father would have it no other way. He wanted to give his best for the Lord, just as Heavenly Father gave His perfect Son for the world.</para>
			<para paraID="14">As David turned his team back toward home, a good feeling came over him. He was glad his father had taught him the law of tithing. It was a lesson he would remember all his life.</para>

				<para paraID="19">1. Explain that Jesus Christ came into the world to do the will of the Father. Discuss what the Father’s will is. Help the children memorize <scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="19" verse="24">D&amp;C 19:24</scriptureRef> by dividing the children into three groups. Have the first group say, “I am Jesus Christ.” Have the second group say, “I came by the <emphasis>will</emphasis> of the Father.” Have the third group say, “and I do his <emphasis>will.</emphasis>” Repeat, rotating so that each group says each part.</para>

Have them clap on each syllable. Have the second group clap and chant, “I will go; I will do” four times. Then have the groups clap and chant together. Explain that Jesus’s mission was to do the will of the Father. Our mission is to follow Heavenly Father’s commandments. Bear testimony that Jesus fulfilled His mission and that we will be blessed as we keep the commandments.</para>
				<para paraID="21">2. Display three shoe boxes, and ask the children to raise their hands if they like to try on new shoes. Explain that you want them to imagine trying on some other people’s shoes, but more important you want them to imagine what it would be like to actually be that person. One by one, take out a pair of shoes from each box. (You can also display pictures or drawings of shoes.) Show a pair of boots to represent the soldiers who guarded Jesus’s tomb. Use detail to tell the story in such a way that the children can imagine being there when Jesus Christ was laid in the tomb. Next, use a pair of sandals to tell the story of Mary Magdalene. Ask the children how it might have felt to have been at the garden tomb when the resurrected Savior appeared. Last, show a pair of shoes that children in your area commonly wear. Ask how it feels to be a member of the Church and to have the knowledge that you will be resurrected because of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</para>
				<para paraID="22">Sing <crossRef fileIDref="35395_000_066" paraIDref="1">“Did Jesus Really Live Again?”</crossRef> (p. 64), and bear testimony that the Easter story is the most glorious story in the world. Testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died and was resurrected.</para>
				<para paraID="23">3. Using pushpins, a bulletin board, and brightly colored yarn, write the word <emphasis>wrong</emphasis> at the front of the room, using yarn to create each letter. Tell the children that when they repent they turn wrong into right. Ask the children to help you turn the word <emphasis>wrong</emphasis> into <emphasis>right</emphasis> by figuring out what they could do to repent. Use three case studies (see <crossRef fileIDref="36123_000_085" paraIDref="133">“Case Studies,”</crossRef> <emphasis>TNGC,</emphasis> 161–62) to give situations where children need to repent. After the first case study, have a child remove the <emphasis>w</emphasis> and form it into a <emphasis>t</emphasis>. Sing <crossRef fileIDref="35395_000_114" paraIDref="1">“The Fourth Article of Faith”</crossRef> (p. 124), and explain that repentance is the second principle of the gospel. After the second case study, have a child make the <emphasis>n</emphasis> into an <emphasis>h</emphasis>. Sing <crossRef fileIDref="35395_000_093" paraIDref="1">“Repentance”</crossRef> (p. 98). After the third case study, have a child shape the <emphasis>o</emphasis> into an <emphasis>i</emphasis> without the dot. Sing <crossRef fileIDref="35395_000_094" paraIDref="1">“Help Me, Dear Father”</crossRef> (p. 99), and explain that we need to forgive others who repent. Use a sticker to put a dot above the <emphasis>i</emphasis>. Put a dot on each child’s right hand, and explain that it is to help them remember to choose the right and to turn wrong into right. Put the letters in order on the board. Recite from My Gospel Standards, “I will choose the right. I know I can repent when I make a mistake.” Bear your testimony of repentance and of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</para>
				<para paraID="24"><emphasis>For younger children: </emphasis>Help the children memorize the poem written by President Boyd K. Packer, Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Add actions as appropriate. President Packer said: “I give you my testimony that the Atonement of Christ can bless your life. I once tried to express in writing what it means to me”:</para>

				<para paraID="30">4. Tell the children that you are going to ask them a trick question. Ask, “How many prophets do we have on the earth today?” Explain that each member of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is sustained as a prophet, seer, and revelator. That means that we have 15 prophets on the earth! Explain, however, that the President of the Church is the only one who can receive revelation for the entire Church. A week before general conference, ask several older children to report in two weeks on a message that an Apostle gave at general conference. If possible, display a picture of that Apostle as each child tells about the message. Sing <crossRef fileIDref="35395_000_124" paraIDref="1">“Latter-day Prophets”</crossRef> (p. 134), but substitute the names of our living prophets. (You can find their names in order of seniority on the masthead of any Church magazine.) Begin with “Today’s living prophets are: number one, Gordon B. Hinckley; Thomas S. Monson<nb/>…” Substitute the names of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, fitting the names to the music. End with, “We hear and follow <emphasis>their</emphasis> words today.” Share with the children an experience you have had with one of the Apostles, either in person or by reading his words. Testify that these men have been called of God and that they are leading our Church today. Promise the children that their faith will grow as they heed the counsel of today’s living prophets.</para>

Invite the children to look up <scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="76" verse="22">D&amp;C 76:22</scriptureRef>. Preface the scripture by explaining that Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon had a vision. Read the scripture together. Point out the exclamation point at the end. Ask the children to read the scripture again and say the last two words with enthusiasm, “he lives!” Tell them that those two words are in a beautiful hymn. Ask them to count how many times you sing “he lives.” Teach the chorus first. Divide the Primary into four groups. Have each group sing one phrase that begins with “He lives.” Combine the four groups into two groups and then finally into one group.</para>
				<para paraID="32">To teach the first verse, tell the children that in the first sentence they will find out who the “He” is (“my Redeemer”). Sing the second sentence, and ask them what sentence brings comfort (“I know that my Redeemer lives” or “He lives”). Before singing the third sentence, ask, “Who was dead?” (Jesus Christ). After singing the fourth sentence, ask why Jesus is called “Head” (explain that He is the head of our Church; we belong to The Church of <emphasis>Jesus Christ</emphasis> of Latter-day Saints). Sing the whole hymn. Tell the children that this hymn is a testimony of Church members just as <scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="76" verse="22">D&amp;C 76:22</scriptureRef> is the testimony of Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon. Bear your testimony, and then invite the children to bear their testimonies with you by singing “I Know That My Redeemer Lives.”</para>

			<para paraID="6">Kasey was a good student. She knew this because her kindergarten teacher had moved her from the red reading group to the blue one, the top reading group in the class.</para>
			<para paraID="7">But now Kasey would be starting first grade. What if the work was too hard? What if she wasn’t one of the best students in her class anymore? If there were reading groups in the first grade, Kasey wanted to stay in the top group.</para>
			<para paraID="8">On the first day of school, Miss Nelson handed out a spelling worksheet. “When you’re finished, put your paper in the basket on the counter,” she instructed.</para>
			<para paraID="9">Kasey worked hard. When she stood to hand in her assignment, she beamed. The basket was empty. She was the first student finished! Maybe first grade wouldn’t be so hard after all.</para>
			<para paraID="10">Kasey soon discovered that Miss Nelson’s class did spelling assignments every morning. And for several weeks, Kasey was the first to finish. “I must be the best speller in class,” she told herself.</para>
			<para paraID="11">One day, she noticed her friend Shantelle march over to the counter and plunk her worksheet in the basket. Kasey’s jaw dropped. She wasn’t even half finished with hers! She filled in the rest of the answers quickly and sauntered over to the basket, sliding her assignment under Shantelle’s. Maybe Miss Nelson wouldn’t notice who had finished first.</para>
			<para paraID="12">On Monday it rained. Thunder crashed outside as raindrops drummed on the window. “After we do our spelling, we’ll have morning recess inside,” Miss Nelson announced. “When you finish your assignment, you may go pick out a puzzle or a game from that shelf. Please copy our spelling list for the week.” Miss Nelson pointed to the board. “Then write each word four times.”</para>
			<para paraID="13">Kasey’s wrist ached as she scribbled down the words. Her pencil tip snapped, but she kept writing with the dull end. Her heart thudded. She wrote faster. Finally she blew out a little puff of air as she triumphantly placed her paper in the empty basket. Kasey scurried to the shelf and chose a puzzle of a kitten snoozing in a flowerbed.</para>
			<para paraID="14">Kasey had just found all the corner pieces when she felt someone standing next to her. “Can I help?” Shantelle asked.</para>
			<para paraID="15">Kasey gulped. “Sure.”</para>
			<para paraID="16">Shantelle pulled up a chair and started sorting out the pieces with straight edges. She and Shantelle had spent recess together lots of times, but for some reason today Kasey felt nervous. She had been so busy trying to beat Shantelle lately that she hadn’t taken the time to be very nice to her.</para>
			<para paraID="17"><pageBreak pageNum="20"/>“I saw your spelling assignment,” Shantelle said. “It was kind of messy.” Shantelle seemed surprised—it wasn’t like her friend to be so sloppy.</para>
			<para paraID="18">Kasey’s cheeks burned. She stared down at the puzzle pieces, finishing the puzzle in silence. All day, Kasey worried about what Shantelle had said.</para>
			<para paraID="19">At the end of class, Miss Nelson returned the spelling lists. “Use these to study for the quiz on Friday,” she said. She raised her eyebrows as she handed Kasey her paper. “Please write more neatly next time,” she said. She had circled all the words that were difficult to read. Suddenly Kasey didn’t feel so smart.</para>
			<para paraID="20">Before the bell rang, Kasey pulled out a new sheet of paper and began copying the words from the board again, this time writing as neatly as she could. That way she would know the right way to spell them when she studied the list later. The best student would try to spell the words correctly, she decided, not just copy them quickly.</para>
			<para paraID="21">The next day Kasey didn’t watch the basket while she worked. She looked straight down at her spelling worksheet and thought hard about the questions. She wrote the answers neatly in the blanks. When she finally turned in the assignment, she decided to be honest. She placed it on top of a small stack of papers already waiting there. Miss Nelson smiled at her. Kasey smiled back. She knew in her heart that now she was becoming the best student she could be.</para>

			<para paraID="4"><pageBreak pageNum="28"/>From her backyard, Clara Christensen, 11, enjoys a view pretty enough for a calendar page. Her home sits on the brink of a hill overlooking Lake of the Woods, a vast sheet of clear water that reaches south into the United States and west into Manitoba. In summertime the sun glitters on the water. In winter the lake shines with snow-covered ice.</para>
			<para paraID="5">The lake and surrounding woods are a dreamland for an active, outdoor-loving person like Clara. She swims, rows, fishes, hikes, and camps in the summer. In the winter she enjoys skating, snowmobiling, cross-country and downhill skiing, and sliding down steep hills on carpet blocks. Winter temperatures dip as low as –40˚C at night, and snow lies between four and seven feet (1–2 m) deep. And yet fall and winter are Clara’s favorite seasons.</para>
			<para paraID="6">This rugged outdoor girl has many indoor interests as well. She enjoys <pageBreak pageNum="29"/>reading, knitting, and playing the recorder and piano. She has set a goal of learning to play all the hymns and Primary songs. Clara has a soft heart and delights in nurturing both people and animals. She often babysits her cousins, and when real children aren’t available, she mothers her collection of dolls. Cats are another great love. Lilo, Hero, and Hope adore her and often sleep on her bed. Noah’s ark is her favorite scripture story because of all the animals. When Clara grows up she wants to work with either babies or cats.</para>
			<para paraID="7">Whatever she does, she will do it well because she sticks to a task until it is done right. This quality has pulled her through some tough challenges. Clara was diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech. This means that although she knew what she wanted to say, the signals became scrambled somehow between her brain and her mouth so she couldn’t speak clearly. Clara has spent countless hours learning how to move her jaw, lips, and tongue to make sounds properly and blend those sounds into words. This has been very hard work, but with her parents’ help, she has practiced relentlessly and continues to do so. She now speaks well, though some words still require a great effort.</para>
			<para paraID="8">Last year the children in Clara’s grade-four class were assigned to give four-to-five-minute speeches. Clara chose to give a speech on the Holocaust, which she presented as if she were a girl in a concentration camp. When she first rehearsed her speech, it took eight minutes and 40 seconds to give because many of the words were hard to say. She practiced it over and over. The speech slowly grew shorter as she learned to say the words fluently. She finally presented the speech in four minutes and 40 seconds, and her classmates chose her to represent them in front of the whole school. When she did, the entire student body broke into wild applause. Many of them <pageBreak pageNum="30"/>had known Clara since grade one, and her progress seemed miraculous. “The principal was crying,” Clara’s mom recalls. “Clara’s grade-two teacher was crying. Her grade-four teacher was cheering. It was such a victory—one of the greatest moments of my life!”</para>
			<para paraID="9">What did Clara learn from the experience? “Keep trying,” she counsels children everywhere. “Never give up.”</para>
			<para paraID="10">Of course, prayer was also a vital part of Clara’s triumph. She has great faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Primary, home evenings, scripture study, and her parents’ teachings have helped. Her older sisters have made a difference too, both through their good examples and their reading materials. As soon as Carly, 18, and Josie, 15, turned 12 in their turn, they began putting <emphasis>New Era</emphasis> Posters on their mirrors. Clara has also memorized seminary scripture mastery scriptures and learned President Hinckley’s six B’s with her sisters.</para>
			<para paraID="11">Her father is the branch president, and her mother is the Young Women president, so Clara stays involved in branch activities. The Kenora Branch is small during fall, winter, and spring. In fact, Clara is usually the only member of her Primary class, which is taught by her grandmother, the Primary president. But in the summertime, when thousands of tourists pour in to enjoy Lake of the Woods, the branch fills up with visitors each Sunday. Clara basks in all the wonderful new friendships. The family stays close to the Church all year long by attending stake activities in Winnipeg, Manitoba, some two and a half hours to the west. Coming home at night, they often see the northern lights dancing in the sky.</para>
			<para paraID="12">Clara also stays close to her extended family. On Christmas Eve cousins and uncles and aunts all sleep over at Grandma’s house. They eat, sing, hang stockings, set up a nativity scene, hear the Christmas story, and kneel together in prayer. Christmas morning brings hot chocolate, hot cross buns, and gifts. On Christmas night the families meet again at Clara’s house for dinner. On Boxing Day (the day after Christmas) there is a progressive dinner with different dishes at the home of each family.</para>
			<para paraID="13">Clara has grown up inspired by the beauty of nature, the warmth of family love, and the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. All these influences are reflected clearly in her face and her spirit. Even on the coldest day of winter she warms the lives of those who know her best. As her mom says, “Thank goodness we have Clara.”</para>

			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="32"/>Andy’s little sister, Trisha, had been born with many health problems. She needed extra help to do even the smallest thing. Trisha was 18 months old, but she couldn’t walk or sit up or even roll over. She couldn’t feed herself and had to eat through a tube.</para>

When we got home from Primary my little sister, Julia, dropped her ring down the bathroom vent and started to cry. I remembered that I had an extra CTR ring from last year, so I ran upstairs to get it. I hurried back down and gave it to my sister. When she stopped crying I felt good inside.</para>

As I was making my way to her, I saw a new student, Bintu, from Africa. She did not speak English. She was sitting all alone with a frown on her face. Thinking of what Jesus Christ would do, I quickly turned around and sat by Bintu. She began to smile happily. Everyone else was shocked, but I knew that I had done the right thing.</para>

During lunch that day my mom took me to my violin lesson. I felt bad about cheating, and even though I was scared to tell my mom about it, I did. She said I needed to tell the teacher what had happened. When we got back to school my mother asked if I needed her to come with me to tell my teacher. I told her no. I was scared for the rest of the school day. I kept walking up to my teacher to tell her and then going back to my desk because I was too scared. Finally at the end of the day I told my teacher what happened. She marked the answer wrong but then gave me a hug and told me, “Thank you for being honest.” I’m glad I told my teacher even though it was very hard. I felt much better afterward. I will never cheat on a test again. I will always try to be honest in everything I do.</para>

			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="45"/>Lexi ran outside with the rest of Mrs. Crandall’s third-grade class for recess. What should she play today? Sometimes she jumped rope with Tara and Isabella. Sometimes she played foursquare with David and Kristina and Callie. But Lexi wanted to do something different today. Maybe she should join the soccer game.</para>
			<para paraID="6">Then Lexi noticed something very different.</para>
			<para paraID="7">A new girl sat near the edge of the playground. She had brown skin and long, shiny hair that reminded Lexi of her piano teacher’s glossy black piano. Lexi thought the new girl looked like a princess from another country.</para>
			<para paraID="8">Why wasn’t anyone playing with the new girl? Lexi decided to ask a teacher.</para>
			<para paraID="9">“Her name is Nasimah,” the teacher said. “She’s from Pakistan. She doesn’t speak English, but I’m sure she’d like to play with you.”</para>
			<para paraID="10">“I don’t know,” Lexi said. She wondered how she could play with the new girl if they couldn’t talk to each other. How would she say, “What do you want to play?” or, “It’s your turn,” or even, “Hello”?</para>
			<para paraID="11">Lexi decided to jump rope with Isabella after all. But she watched Nasimah whenever she could.</para>
			<para paraID="12">At home, Lexi couldn’t stop thinking of Nasimah and how lonely she must be. There had to be a way to talk to her. Maybe Mom could think of something.</para>
			<para paraID="13">Lexi found her mother in the laundry room. She was sewing patches on Lexi’s brother’s Scout shirt. “Do you know any words from Pakistan?” Lexi asked.</para>
			<para paraID="14">“No,” Mom said. “Why?”</para>
			<para paraID="15">Lexi explained about Nasimah.</para>
			<para paraID="16">“If you want to play with her, I think you should,” Mom said, “even if you can’t understand her words.”</para>
			<para paraID="17">“I don’t know,” Lexi said. She hung her head and played with the spools of thread in Mom’s sewing box. A ball of black yarn reminded Lexi of Nasimah’s shiny hair.</para>
			<para paraID="18">An idea was coming together in Lexi’s brain. “Mom,” she said, “do you have an old sock I can use?”</para>
			<para paraID="19">“An old sock? I suppose so.”</para>
			<para paraID="20">“And can I use some of this yarn?” Lexi dug through the box and found the button jar. “And a couple of buttons?”</para>
			<para paraID="21">“Sure,” Mom said.</para>
			<para paraID="22">With a little help from Mom, Lexi made the perfect sock puppet. Its <pageBreak pageNum="46"/>hair was black, just like Nasimah’s hair. Its button eyes were blue, just like Lexi’s eyes. Mom helped Lexi make a red dress for the puppet.</para>
			<para paraID="23">The next day, Lexi thought recess would never come. Concentrating on her spelling test was hard. She kept thinking of the sock puppet in her backpack. Finally recess came and Lexi raced outside with the puppet.</para>
			<para paraID="24">Where was Nasimah? Lexi looked all over the playground. At last, Nasimah came out with her class and stood by the wall.</para>
			<para paraID="25">Lexi took a deep breath. Would the puppet work? It had seemed like such a wonderful idea yesterday.</para>
			<para paraID="26">“I have to try,” Lexi thought.</para>
			<para paraID="27">She walked slowly over to Nasimah. Lexi held up the puppet and slipped it over her hand. Moving her hand, she made the puppet talk.</para>
			<para paraID="28">“Hi!” the puppet said in Lexi’s voice. “Do you want to play with me?”</para>
			<para paraID="29">Lexi took the puppet off her hand. She gave it to Nasimah and helped her put it on her hand.</para>
			<para paraID="30">Nasimah moved the sock puppet. It began to speak strange words that danced in Lexi’s ears. They took turns with the puppet for the rest of recess. When Lexi held the puppet, it spoke English. When Nasimah held the puppet, it spoke her language. Lexi thought she was starting to understand a couple of words.</para>
			<para paraID="31">When the bell rang, Lexi handed the puppet to her new friend. “You keep it,” Lexi said. “It’s a present.”</para>
			<para paraID="32">Nasimah seemed to understand. She kept the puppet and smiled.</para>
			<para paraID="33">“Smiles are the same in all languages,” Lexi thought. And she smiled back.</para>

In the middle of the circle draw things that represent obedience to Heavenly Father, such as the scriptures, a temple, and a CTR symbol. Then draw other things that are important to you, such as hobbies, around the outside of the circle. Each day, try to give your best time and effort to the things in the middle of the circle.</para>
