			<p data-aid="132021532" id="p2">When I was in seventh grade I decided to participate in a running competition against the other middle schools. What I didn’t know was that the area we were running in was hilly, and so running would be a lot harder than I was used to.</p>
			<p data-aid="132021533" id="p3">When I was a little over halfway through the race, I slowed to a walk and just decided that I couldn’t do it. Tears came, and I felt weak and embarrassed.</p>
			<p data-aid="132021534" id="p4">As I was about to stop and sit down, two eighth-grade girls from my school caught up to me and started encouraging me to keep going. I reluctantly started to slowly jog with them, with one on each side of me. My whole body was aching, but I kept on going. When we were finally in sight of the finish line, my youngest sister came to run with me too.</p>
			<p data-aid="132021535" id="p5">When we crossed the finish line, I was relieved. I received a ribbon for seventh place, and I felt embarrassed since there were only seven girls who ran. But now it reminds me of how I completed something that seemed so impossible.</p>
			<p data-aid="132021536" id="p6">Life is hard, but when we feel like stopping, we need to remember that our friends, family, Heavenly Father, and Savior will always be there to help us through it.</p>
