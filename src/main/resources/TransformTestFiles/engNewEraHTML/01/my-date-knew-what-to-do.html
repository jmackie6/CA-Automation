			<p data-aid="132021614" id="p3">When I was 17 years old, one of my good friends asked me to go on a group date with him. We went to the park with a couple of our friends and played volleyball, ate treats, and talked around the fire to finish off the night. We had a lot of fun, and I was happy that I could spend that time getting to know my date. Just as we were getting ready to leave, a group of boys who were about our same age approached us. Almost instantly, I felt uneasy. Those boys were acting so strangely; they talked too loudly, and their eyes were red and glazed over.</p>
			<p data-aid="132021615" id="p4">One of them lifted something to his mouth, blew out a lot of smoke, and said, “Looks like you guys are having a party. Mind if we join?”</p>
			<p data-aid="132021616" id="p5">My date politely responded, “We’re actually just about to leave. We were just cleaning up.”</p>
			<p data-aid="132021617" id="p6">One of the boys then said, “But we’d love to join you! Besides, the party just started! Do you guys want to share a smoke?”</p>
			<p data-aid="132021618" id="p7">It was then that I realized that they weren’t smoking just regular cigarettes, and I completely froze. I realized why the Spirit had warned me so quickly. I didn’t want to be rude, but I also knew I didn’t want anything to do with whatever they had to offer. I was so relieved that I was with my friend—a worthy priesthood holder—who shared my standards and could sense how uncomfortable I was.</p>
			<p data-aid="132021619" id="p8">Without hesitating, my date said, “No, thanks. We’re not into that kind of stuff. Have a good night!” And we left the park.</p>
			<p data-aid="132021620" id="p9">As he drove me home, I felt the Spirit’s peace come back. I told him how grateful I was that he shared my standards and that he had been there to help me out of that difficult situation. The <em>For the Strength of Youth</em> pamphlet counsels us to “date only those who have high moral standards and in whose company you can maintain your standards. Remember that a young man and a young woman on a date are responsible to protect each other’s honor and virtue” ([2011], 4). Though his actions were simple, my date helped me to maintain my standards.</p>
			<p data-aid="132021621" id="p10">I’ve learned that if I choose to be around and date people who share my standards, I will be blessed with the Spirit and the decision to keep the commandments and maintain my standards will be easier.</p>
