					</header>
					<p data-aid="" id="p1">With the start of 2017, it’s time for a brand new album of Mutual Theme songs written by youth, for youth! Check it out on <a href="http://lds.org/youth/theme/2017">lds.org/youth/theme/2017</a> or on Spotify or Apple Music.</p>
					<p data-aid="" id="p2">Here’s what some of the songwriters say about the inspiration for their songs:</p>
					<p data-aid="" id="p3">Justin Garvin wrote his song, “Choose to Stay,” about suicide prevention, because after several experiences with friends passing away, he wanted to make a difference and focus on hope.</p>
					<p data-aid="" id="p4">Jaeden Vaifanua wrote her song, “What Family Means,” about her love for her own family—even when they all sing off-key during road trips.</p>
					<p data-aid="" id="p5">Nefi Hernández wrote his song, “I Hear His Voice,” about prayer and how it doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from—the Lord will answer.</p>
					<p data-aid="" id="p6">“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of god, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.”—James 1:5–6</p>
