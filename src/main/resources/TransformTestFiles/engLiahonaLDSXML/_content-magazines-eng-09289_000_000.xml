			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="4"/>All of us feel, in our best moments, a desire to return home to live with God. He gave us the gift of His Beloved Son as our Savior to provide the path and to teach us how to follow it. He gave us prophets to point the way. The Prophet Joseph Smith was inspired to translate the record of prophets that is the Book of Mormon. It is our sure guide on the way home to God.</para>
			<para paraID="6">Joseph Smith said of that precious book, “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker></para>
			<para paraID="7">The precepts of the Book of Mormon are the commandments of God we find in it. Some are direct commands from the Savior through His prophets as to what we are to do and what we are to become. The Book of Mormon gives us the Savior’s example to increase our faith and determination to obey His command to follow Him. The book is filled with the doctrine of Christ to guide us. Here is an example from 2<nb/>Nephi:</para>
			<para paraID="8">“[Jesus] said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</para>
			<para paraID="9">“And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son” (<scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="31" verse="10-11">2<nb/>Nephi 31:10–11</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="10">The book makes plain that we must receive the Holy Ghost as a baptism of fire to help us stay on the strait and narrow path. We are taught that we must pray always in the name of Christ, not fainting, and that if we do, we have this promise: “Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="31" verse="20">2<nb/>Nephi 31:20</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="11">The Book of Mormon makes plain in the marvelous sermon of King Benjamin what it means to have a love of God and of all men. When our natures are changed by the power of the Atonement and through our faithful obedience to the commandments, we will be filled with the love of God (see <scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="4" verse="1-12">Mosiah 4:1–12</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="12">The Book of Mormon also gives us confidence that we can become so purified in this life that we have no more <pageBreak pageNum="5"/>desire to do evil (see <scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="5" verse="2">Mosiah 5:2</scriptureRef>). This hope gives us courage and comfort as Satan tries to tempt and discourage us on our way.</para>
			<para paraID="13">Each time I read even a few lines in the Book of Mormon, I feel my testimony strengthened that the book is true, that Jesus is the Christ, that we can follow Him home, and that we can take those we love home with us. It has been for me the book of books. It is the word of God.</para>
			<para paraID="14">I pray that we and all those we love will drink deeply and daily from it. I testify in the name of Jesus Christ that it is a true guide.</para>

Hinckley (1910–2008) issued a challenge to Church members to read the Book of Mormon before the end of the year, I promised myself I would read the entire book. I was familiar with stories in the Book of Mormon but had never read it all the way through. Now I meant to keep my promise.</para>
					<para paraID="5">I had been taught to apply the scriptures to my life and make them my very own. So as I read, I wrote in the margins of the page what I thought the main idea of the passage was. I also underlined repeated words and phrases to show emphasis.</para>
					<para paraID="6">I placed my name next to names in the scriptures to help me remember that the word of God spoken to others can also be the word spoken to me. For example, in <scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="2" verse="28">2<nb/>Nephi 2:28</scriptureRef> I wrote my name: “And now, [Hillary], I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments.” The more I made the Book of Mormon my own, the more excited I became about reading it every day.</para>
					<para paraID="7">As I read daily, my prayers became heartfelt and personal. I was also able to focus on my classes and follow promptings of the Spirit to befriend others. On the last night of the year, I finished the Book of Mormon.</para>
					<para paraID="8">I then understood the importance of reading the whole Book of Mormon, along with other scriptures, and want to do so many more times in my life.</para>

I think I have never missed a spring since I was married, except for two or three years when we were absent from the city, that I have not planted trees.<nb/>…</para>
					<para paraID="6">“Some 36 years ago I planted a black walnut [tree]. It was in a crowded area where it grew straight and tall to get the sunlight. A year ago, for some reason it died. But walnut is a precious furniture wood. I called Brother Ben Banks of the Seventy, who, before giving his full time to the Church, was in the business of hardwood lumber. He brought his two sons, one a bishop and the other recently released as a bishop and who now run the business, to look at the tree. From all they could tell it was solid, good, and beautiful wood. One of them suggested that it would make a pulpit for this hall. The idea excited me. The tree was cut down and then cut into two heavy logs. Then followed the long process of drying, first naturally and then kiln drying. The logs were cut into boards at a sawmill in Salem, Utah. The boards were then taken to Fetzer’s woodworking plant, where expert craftsmen designed and built this magnificent pulpit with that wood.</para>
					<para paraID="7">“The end product is beautiful. I wish all of you could examine it closely. It represents superb workmanship, and here I am speaking to you from the tree I grew in my backyard, where my children played and also grew.</para>
					<para paraID="8">“It is an emotional thing for me. I have planted another black walnut or two. I will be long gone before they mature. When that day comes and this beautiful pulpit has grown old, perhaps one of them will do to make a replacement. To Elder Banks and his sons, Ben and Bradley, and to the skilled workers who have designed and built this, I offer my profound thanks for making it possible to have a small touch of mine in this great hall where the voices of prophets will go out to all the world in testimony of the Redeemer of mankind.”</para>

			<para paraID="4"><pageBreak pageNum="10"/>I was born and raised in the Philippines, where I met and married my wife, Monina. It was there that our son, Mark, was born. In the mid-1990s, our family moved to Saipan, which is a small island in the Pacific. There, we were active members of another church. Occasionally, I’d see pairs of young men walking around the island, dressed neatly in white shirts and ties. I knew they were Latter-day Saint missionaries, but I had no plans to join another church. When I saw them coming my way, I would literally turn and run in the opposite direction.</para>
			<para paraID="5">My attitude toward the missionaries changed when two friends, Mel and Soledad Espinosa, were baptized into the Church. They encouraged our family to meet with the missionaries, and mostly out of curiosity, we agreed to do so. Our first meeting was in August 2007, and as the missionaries shared their message, I felt something powerful. My heart beat faster, and I felt a tingling sensation throughout my entire body. I later learned that my entire family felt inspired and uplifted. Our feelings intensified in the ensuing months as we learned more about the gospel of Jesus Christ.</para>
			<para paraID="6">About the time we began meeting with the missionaries, Monina’s energy began to decrease, and strange bumps started appearing all over her body. Her arthritis flared up as it never had before. We sought medical help, but none of the tests gave us any answers. As the months passed, her health deteriorated to the point that she needed additional medical attention. In December, Monina flew to the Philippines to meet with doctors there. I stayed in Saipan so I could continue to work and care for our teenage son.</para>
			<para paraID="7">Before she left, Monina told me that she wanted to be baptized when she returned to Saipan. She also asked me to continue meeting with the missionaries even though she would be missing some of the lessons. I promised her that Mark and I would do so.</para>
			<para paraID="8">During her time in the Philippines, we talked regularly so that I could hear about her doctor visits and she could hear what we were learning about the gospel. My wife reported that she was feeling less and less pain every day, and I was glad that the medical attention was working. In early January 2008, I purchased a plane ticket so I could go visit her, but she felt certain that she would be back in Saipan soon and that there was no need to waste money on the trip. She told me she loved and missed our son and me but assured me everything would be all right.</para>
			<para paraID="9">Three days later she died suddenly. The cause: undetected leukemia. Mark and I were stunned—and heartbroken. We immediately traveled to the Philippines for the funeral and then returned to Saipan. This was the most difficult time of our lives.</para>
			<para paraID="10">The sorrow I felt was profound, so much so <pageBreak pageNum="11"/>that I found it hard to get out of bed each morning. One particularly difficult day, Mark reminded me of something the missionaries had taught our family. He said, “Dad, don’t cry too much. Mom is in a place of God. She is in the spirit world.” How grateful I felt that a just God had provided a way for Monina to continue to learn about the gospel, that everyone who has ever lived will have a chance to either accept or reject the gospel of Jesus Christ—either in this life or the next.</para>
			<para paraID="11">As I continued to learn the teachings of Jesus Christ, I realized that Heavenly Father had provided much more than that: He also made it possible for her to receive essential ordinances like baptism. Before my wife left for the Philippines, she and I had started talking about being baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Even though she wasn’t able to be baptized in this life, Heavenly Father had not left us without hope.</para>
			<para paraID="12">Mark and I faced several trials in the following months. After returning to the Philippines for my wife’s funeral, I lost my job. I sold our car to pay Monina’s hospital bills. Plus, Mark and I had to adjust to life without Monina. Despite the adversity, Mark and I found hope in our newfound faith, and we were baptized in April 2008. In the months that followed, I was able to find another job and pay the hospital bills. Mark and I made a goal to attend our branch trip to the Manila Philippines Temple so we could be sealed together as a family.</para>
			<para paraID="13">After saving all our extra income and preparing ourselves spiritually, Mark and I traveled with our branch to the temple in May 2009. As we prepared for the trip, we saw firsthand the destructive hand of the adversary as well as the <pageBreak pageNum="12"/>strengthening and uplifting love of our Heavenly Father. I got extremely sick the day before we were scheduled to leave for the temple. Some members had unexpected immigration problems, while others had trouble obtaining passports. Our friends who introduced my family to the gospel, the Espinosas, lost their jobs the week we were scheduled to attend the temple. Even worse, a member of our branch presidency who was scheduled to attend the temple for the first time lost his father to a sudden illness three days before our trip. But in the end the Lord strengthened each of us and made it possible for 42 members of the branch to attend the temple. Sixteen of us attended for the first time.</para>
			<para paraID="14">May 13, 2009, is a day I will never forget. When I arrived at the temple, the weight and pain of my wife’s death immediately vanished. Although I was initially nervous about the temple because I didn’t know exactly what to do or where to go, I was struck by the calm, peaceful presence I felt once I stepped inside. It was very different from the busy streets just outside the temple doors.</para>
			<para paraID="15">As the day progressed, my temple experience became only more meaningful and more powerful. In the morning our branch participated in baptisms for the dead. As I watched, I found myself thinking of my wife, who a year and a half earlier had expressed her desire to be baptized. I then witnessed the fulfillment of that desire as a friend was baptized for and in behalf of Monina.</para>
			<para paraID="16">The most significant portion of my trip, however, came later that afternoon when I walked into the sealing room. My wife and I were married years ago, but we were not married in the temple by Heavenly Father’s priesthood authority. When my wife died, I thought I had lost her forever. But as I met with the missionaries, I learned that in the temple, families can be sealed together for eternity.</para>
			<para paraID="17">As I walked into the sealing room at the Manila Temple, I was overcome with emotion. Ever since my baptism, I had known the blessings of the gospel were real, but in that instant I truly witnessed their worth. As Mark and I knelt at the altar to be sealed as a family, I felt my wife’s presence. I could hear her voice, and it was as if I were holding her hand. I felt Monina’s presence with every feeling in my heart. I knew then that we were an eternal family.</para>

				<title paraID="24">What Is Really Important</title>
				<image altText="Elder Kenneth Johnson" webURL="JohnsonK_99.jpg"/>
				<para paraID="25">Elder Kenneth Johnson of the Seventy tells of a time when he was painting the exterior of his home and his five-year-old son asked to help: “[After I provided] him with an old shirt of mine that covered him completely, almost touching the floor and with sleeves rolled back several times, we went to work on the door that secured the main entrance to our home. He was applying paint to the bottom panel as I worked on the top section. I noticed that because of his age and physical stature, he wasn’t able to spread the paint evenly and that beads of paint were resulting. Each time he bent down to recharge his brush, I would hastily smooth out the paint on the bottom panel, returning to my assigned area so that he would not realize what I was doing. After a while I decided that more important than a first-class paint job was the opportunity to work with my son. On reflection I realized how well he was doing. Thereafter, every time I approached the door and saw the distinctive style of decoration, I was reminded of what is really important in our lives.”</para>

			<para paraID="4"><pageBreak pageNum="14"/>Several years ago, after hearing a young woman in our ward recite “The Living Christ,”<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker> I decided I would memorize it too. I took a small copy of the document with me as I ran in the early mornings. Because I was alone and distractions were minimal, this was an ideal opportunity for me to think. After several months of this, I was in great physical shape—and I had met my memorization goal.</para>
			<para paraID="5">As good as “finishing” felt, the long-term benefits were even better. I found myself thinking more often about Jesus Christ, His life, and His mission and wanting to be more like Him. I treated my husband and our children with more patience and love. I found greater peace and happiness in all that I did. And I felt greater joy in caring for and loving those around me. Then, like Lehi, who partook of the fruit of the tree of life, I wanted my family to experience what I had (see <scriptureRef book="1-ne" chapter="8" verse="12">1<nb/>Nephi 8:12</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="6">I began seeking for ways that I could teach “The Living Christ” to our children. I recognized that they were young (our oldest was 11) and that this precious document was rather lengthy. But I had a desire, and after I prayed and thought about it often, the Spirit showed me how I could teach my family.</para>
			<para paraID="7">I had long collected pictures cut out of old Church magazines. I went to the box where I kept them and started pulling out pictures that seemed to match the different phrases in “The Living Christ.” For instance, for “He was the Great Jehovah of the Old Testament,” I found a picture of Christ, as Jehovah, talking with Moses. For the next phrase, “Under the direction of His Father,” I found a picture of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ standing together. Within a short time, I had gathered many pictures and paired them with their associated text from “The Living Christ.”</para>
			<para paraID="8">December seemed the perfect time for our family to start focusing on “The Living Christ.” Our children were excited and really got into our endeavor. We posted the pictures we were working on in our kitchen. I noticed that during the day, the kids would say the phrases as they passed by the pictures. When everyone had memorized the set of pictures on the wall, we put them away and started working on a new set.</para>
			<para paraID="9">With each picture, we discussed the gospel and life of Jesus Christ. Our family home evening lessons were filled with stories and lessons about the Savior. My husband taught some of the concepts in “The Living Christ,” bringing new insights.</para>
			<para paraID="10">Family prayers became more meaningful because the children gave more thought to Him in whose name they were praying. The Spirit filled our home. We felt like Nephi when he wrote, “We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ” (<scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="25" verse="26">2<nb/>Nephi 25:26</scriptureRef>). Our home became a place of greater peace.</para>
			<para paraID="11">The blessings poured in, in ways I had never imagined. For instance, although I had tried simplifying some of the words for our youngest child, Joseph, who was four, he persisted in learning the complete document word for word. This became particularly poignant one week at church. The cover of the sacrament meeting program featured a picture of the Savior in Gethsemane that we had used in our memorization. Joseph pointed to the picture and said, “Look, Mommy. ‘He gave His life to atone for the sins of all mankind.’”</para>
			<para paraID="12">Another week we had a rough time at church; the children were more <pageBreak pageNum="15"/>restless than they should have been, especially during the sacrament. The next night we talked about the sacrament in family home evening. We discussed its purpose and how we should behave as the sacrament is being passed. I asked the children what they thought about during the sacrament. Our 10-year-old, Sharanne, commented that she thought about the life of Jesus Christ and the words from “The Living Christ.” Nothing more needed to be said.</para>
			<para paraID="13">Another time, Joseph was having difficulty going to bed. He wasn’t cooperating and was irritable. I asked him to tell me some of “The Living Christ.” As he began, I could feel the Spirit come into the room. He calmed down and changed back into his normal, happy self. Some time later, on another night when he was restless, I tried it again. This time his reply was very different: “No! I don’t want to be happy!” Our young son had learned what remembering Jesus Christ could do. Indeed, the Savior had become more real to all of us.</para>
			<para paraID="14">Our family finished memorizing “The Living Christ” the following Easter. It was the greatest four-month experience we have ever had. Even though the project is over, I know the effects of what we learned can remain with each family member for the rest of our lives.</para>
			<para paraID="15">I know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are real. I am grateful to have a better understanding of Their works and to feel more deeply of Their love. I thank God for the matchless gift of His divine Son and for the beautiful experience of learning of Him and trying to become more like Him.</para>

			<para paraID="3"><pageBreak pageNum="16"/>When Jesus Christ lived on the earth, He taught others a way to live that would lead them to happiness in this life and the next. His message was one of peace, love, and obedience to God’s commandments. “He went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God” (<scriptureRef book="luke" chapter="8" verse="1">Luke 8:1</scriptureRef>).

			<para paraID="4">He told His disciples that the “gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world” (<scriptureRef book="matt" chapter="24" verse="14">Matthew 24:14</scriptureRef>). Therefore, He sent them “forth to preach” (<scriptureRef book="mark" chapter="3" verse="14">Mark 3:14</scriptureRef>). This is the same task He has given us today—share His gospel with others. In 1831 He revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, “This gospel shall be preached unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="133" verse="37">D&amp;C 133:37</scriptureRef>).</para>

			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="18"/>As a member of the Asia Area Presidency, I have the special privilege to serve in an area of the world I learned to love as a young missionary over 45 years ago. Things have changed since then. What was then the Southern Far East Mission now comprises over 25 missions. A few members in a few branches have grown to 750,000 members. Chapels dot the landscape, and temple worship is available to our Asian members.</para>
			<para paraID="6">As the Church has grown in Asia, I have come to love and appreciate a group of people who seek no reward, no honor, and no other worldly emoluments. They seek only to glorify our Father in Heaven. They are our senior missionaries: wonderful, seasoned brothers and sisters who are quietly and diligently helping “to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="1" verse="30">D&amp;C 1:30</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="7">Their experience, faith, testimony, and love enable them to perform wonderful miracles in establishing and strengthening the Church in our part of the Lord’s vineyard—from Ulaanbaatar to New Delhi. They are those whom Micah described: “The remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass” (<scriptureRef book="micah" chapter="5" verse="7">Micah 5:7</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="8">In many cases they were surprised at the locations to which they were called. Some of them, perhaps like the prophet Jonah, may have chosen Tarshish over Nineveh, as it were. But they did not “flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord” or reside “in the belly of the fish three days and three nights” (<scriptureRef book="jonah" chapter="1" verse="3,17">Jonah 1:3, 17</scriptureRef>). Rather, knowing their calls came from the Lord, “they straightway left their nets, and followed him” (<scriptureRef book="matt" chapter="4" verse="20">Matthew 4:20</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="9">Some of their numerous and diverse assignments include working in temples, teaching seminary and institute, serving in mission offices, administering the Perpetual Education Fund, serving in branches (teaching, training, activating, and sharing), mentoring <pageBreak pageNum="20"/>and helping people upgrade job skills and enhance employment, working in their professional specialties (law, finance, engineering, education, health care), coordinating humanitarian services, and providing relief during floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Some of them even get to participate in finding, teaching, and baptizing new members!</para>
			<para paraID="10">Elder Phil and Sister Brenda Frandsen are one such couple. They served in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. In addition to his other responsibilities, Elder Frandsen served as a counselor to the mission president. The following brief interview with the Frandsens illustrates the thoughts and feelings of many couples and may provide insight to those considering missionary service.</para>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="11">What were your thoughts as you contemplated serving a mission?</title>
				<para paraID="12">Sister Frandsen: “We had always talked about serving a mission after our children were grown. When the time came, it was hard to agree on where we would go and what we would do. After much discussion, Elder Frandsen suggested that we leave the choice up to the Lord. When we received our mission call, it could not have been more exciting. We consider it a very special blessing!”</para>
			</topic>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="13">What were your feelings about returning to your original mission field?</title>
				<para paraID="14">Elder Frandsen: “Returning after a 44-year absence has been a most rewarding experience. In an area where there was once a tiny branch in a rented building, there now stands a beautiful stake center. An eight-year-old boy I knew then is a devoted stake president now. Progress in this part of the world has been truly marvelous. Every day there is a new spiritual experience as Sister Frandsen and I labor to help individuals gain or strengthen their testimonies.”</para>
			</topic>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="15">Do you feel that you are effectively utilized?</title>
				<para paraID="16">Elder Frandsen: “We have been able to use our talents and experiences, and we have discovered talents that we didn’t know we had. I have been able to relearn much of my Chinese. Sister Frandsen can answer the phone in Chinese and is able to read names in order to forward the mail. We feel that learning new skills at our age is good for old brains!”</para>
			</topic>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="17">But what about your family?</title>
				<para paraID="18">Sister Frandsen: “I worried about being away from children and grandchildren. However, there are amazing technological advances in communication available to senior missionaries. In some respects, I hear from and see more of our family than we ever did when we were home. We will have at least four grandchildren born while we are here, which we count as one of the greatest blessings of all. Although I will miss holding the newborn babies, we will get to see pictures and videos as soon as each event happens. Rather than taking us away from family, in many ways our mission has brought us closer together.”</para>
				<para paraID="19">Elder Frandsen: “Actually, we feel that we have enlarged our family by going on a mission. We are ‘grandparents’ to the missionaries. Each day we are excited for young missionaries to share their missions with us. We love them—and they love us back! Don’t you enjoy hearing returned missionaries report their experiences of sharing the gospel? We get to hear those experiences every day while they are fresh and largely unedited. Watching the missionaries mature and grow into effective gospel teachers and leaders is priceless!”</para>
				<para paraID="20">Sister Frandsen: “While we have been gone, we have still been doing missionary work back in Arizona. Two of our best friends have invited the missionaries into their homes. Additionally, our daughter and her husband decided to share the gospel with someone. As a <pageBreak pageNum="21"/>result, one of their friends was recently baptized. The more we try to serve, the more blessings we receive. It is impossible to get ahead of the Lord.”</para>
			</topic>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="21">Is serving a mission fulfilling to you personally?</title>
				<para paraID="22">Elder Frandsen: “Missionary work is never boring! There are new challenges and new adventures every day. In addition to our office duties, we teach an English class on Saturday morning and a Gospel Doctrine class on Sunday morning. Twice a week we teach college-preparation English classes for returned missionaries. We are also involved in finding and teaching investigators. Every opportunity for service opens up new doors for teaching the gospel.”</para>
			</topic>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="23">Any advice for couples contemplating a mission?</title>
				<para paraID="24">Sister Frandsen: “Perhaps one of my biggest fears was health concerns; instead, we have experienced health blessings. Our missionary schedule is healthful. We get up early, retire early, exercise daily, and eat nutritious foods. The Lord blesses missionaries with strength to perform their labors. You need not be afraid!”</para>
				<para paraID="25">Elder Frandsen: “We sometimes smile when those back home think that we are making a sacrifice. The sacrifice is minuscule compared to the blessings, joy, and satisfaction that God gives us each day.”</para>
			</topic>
			<para paraID="26">The Frandsens’ experiences are typical of comments we hear from other senior missionaries serving throughout Asia. Recently, one senior couple became emotional when advised that they could finish their mission one month early so they could be home at Christmastime. We assumed that their tears were tears of joy for the opportunity of being reunited with their children and grandchildren at Christmas. Little did we understand that their tears were tears of sadness. Knowing that they might never have another opportunity to serve in this capacity again, they desired to spend one last Christmas in the mission field!</para>
			<para paraID="27">I honor our senior missionaries. They truly are given power in places where needed to lay the foundation of this Church and bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness.</para>

			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="22"/>As a missionary in France, Chris Ivie served in a small branch where no investigators had attended church in at least a year. Moreover, members couldn’t remember the last time someone had been baptized.</para>
			<para paraID="6">Elder Ivie and his companion prayed about what to do and felt prompted to make sure that each family in the branch had—and was using—a copy of <emphasis>Preach My Gospel.</emphasis> At that point in early 2006, the “Guide to Missionary Service” had been available for just over a year. Elder Ivie and his companion acted on their prompting and ordered and distributed copies of the book.</para>
			<para paraID="7">That was the beginning of big changes for the branch. Although Elder Ivie was in the branch for only two more months, he watched <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> transform the attitudes of <pageBreak pageNum="23"/>Church members—youth and adults alike—about missionary work.</para>
			<para paraID="8">“It was working!” remembers Chris. “Members were thinking about missionary work and trying to share the gospel and having great experiences. There was more missionary activity than the branch had seen in years.”</para>
			<para paraID="9">Members began reporting regularly to the missionaries about gospel conversations they were having with family members, friends, or colleagues. When those friends agreed to come to branch activities, other members welcomed them warmly. For Elder Ivie and his companion, that meant they were knocking on doors less and teaching the gospel more. One of the investigators they began teaching was later baptized.</para>
			<para paraID="10">“Sometimes we have this misperception in the Church that missionary work is only for missionaries to do,” says Chris. “But when the members of this branch were prepared through studying <emphasis>Preach My Gospel,</emphasis> they came to realize that they had a role in finding people to be taught. <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> helped give them the missionary spirit.”</para>
			<para paraID="11">Chris has now been home in Medway, Massachusetts, for nearly three years, but he still uses <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis>in his daily study as a gateway to the scriptures. “It helped me be a better missionary. It has helped me be a better gospel teacher. And it is helping me be a better, more Christlike person,” he says.</para>
			<para paraID="12">Chris is not the only member of the Hingham Massachusetts Stake to discover the power of <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> outside the parameters of full-time missionary service. Although the resource is certainly intended for full-time missionaries, <emphasis>member</emphasis> missionaries in the Hingham stake are finding that it can bless and enrich their lives as well.</para>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="13">From Mission to Home</title>
				<para paraID="14">James Setterberg was also part of the first generation of missionaries to use <emphasis>Preach My Gospel.</emphasis> When he arrived in the Texas Houston East Mission in 2005, his fellow missionaries had been using the resource for several months. But because of the example of a local priesthood leader, Elder Setterberg realized that the tool’s usefulness wasn’t limited to the missionaries.</para>
				<para paraID="15">“In one area, we missionaries lived in the home of a stake president and his family. Every morning, they got up <pageBreak pageNum="24"/>for scripture study, which included going through the various chapters of <emphasis>Preach My Gospel.</emphasis> That’s when I realized that this book really is for everyone,” he says.</para>
				<para paraID="16">It was a lesson he brought home with him. “Before my mission, I had never really set specific goals for my life; I guess I didn’t want to overshoot things,” he admits. “But because of the emphasis on goal setting from my mission president and chapter 8 of <emphasis>Preach My Gospel,</emphasis> that began to change.”</para>
				<para paraID="17">Weekly planning and goal-setting sessions for two years formed a habit that James has retained since his return home. He has, for example, set and worked toward educational and spiritual goals. He says, “I’ve come to realize that without setting goals, you can’t really tell where you are in life, progression-wise. But when you do set and work toward goals, you stretch yourself and become a better person. I have <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> to thank for learning that.”</para>
			</topic>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="18">In Teaching at Church and in the Family</title>
				<para paraID="19">Even members who didn’t use <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> as missionaries are discovering its power. Jake Peterson is a member of the stake’s young single adult branch. Although he served his mission before <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> became available, Jake says the resource has been invaluable to him in his calling as branch mission leader because it explains the reasons we share the gospel: “Sometimes we as members might think, ‘What’s the big deal about missionary work? My neighbors are living good lives and doing good things. Why should I create a possibly awkward situation by talking to them about the Church?’ <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> goes over that. It explains why we share the gospel and talk to our friends: because the gospel of Jesus Christ ‘will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires.’”<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="20">It also helps keep all members founded in basic gospel doctrines, he says. “There’s a quote I like from Hyrum Smith about teaching the first principles of the gospel, then teaching them again and again.<noteMarker noteRef="2">2</noteMarker> That statement and the doctrines contained in <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> have given me a greater understanding of the power of the basics and an appreciation for the strength we can gain from studying things like the Restoration, faith, the Atonement, or repentance. There is great power in those things.”</para>
				<para paraID="21">Another member of the stake, Rick Doane, was serving as the ward mission leader when <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> first became available. Rick immediately sensed that this new tool could help him in his calling.</para>
				<para paraID="22">“I love the fact that the book includes a chapter on how to work with stake and ward leaders. <pageBreak pageNum="25"/>Missionaries come and go, but ward leaders will be there in the long run. They’re the sustainability factor. I love that the book emphasizes the importance of that,” says Rick.</para>
				<para paraID="23">Rick and his wife, Moshi, have also seen the potential for the book as a resource for teaching their young sons. “There is a 15-minute lesson in each chapter that can be perfect for family home evening,” Rick explains. “It is principle focused, so it helps keep you to the basics, which can help you build a strong foundation for yourself and your children. The book even lists scriptures and activities you can use. It’s a great resource to draw from, whether you’re teaching in the home or elsewhere.”</para>

				<title paraID="24">In Preparing for the Future</title>
				<para paraID="25">Mark Wadsworth, age 19, is now serving in the Spain Bilbao Mission and regularly uses <emphasis>Preach My Gospel.</emphasis> But even before his mission, he studied from it. “Every time I have gone through it, there has always been something new to get out of it,” he says.</para>
				<para paraID="26">Studying <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> before his mission helped him identify missionary opportunities. The missionaries in his area helped him and his family develop a family mission plan. “That got me thinking about missionary work in a more proactive way,” he says. As a result, he had more conversations with friends about the Church’s doctrines, its history, and Church-related activities.</para>
				<para paraID="27">“I might have had a similar amount of opportunities to talk about the Church before we made our plan, but I came to react differently to them,” says Elder Wadsworth. “It was just a matter of thinking a little bit differently about things I was already doing.”</para>
				<para paraID="28">Andrew Mello, age 18, still has several months before he submits his mission papers, but that doesn’t mean he’s not actively preparing now. Studying <emphasis>Preach My Gospel,</emphasis> he says, has been one of the best ways he’s been able to do so.</para>
				<para paraID="29">Some preparation has come through personal study. Other times it comes from training in his priests quorum. On the first Sunday of each month, a member of the quorum is assigned to teach a lesson from <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> to his peers and adviser. Sometimes they teach the full 45-minute lesson, but other times, just for practice, they’ll teach the 15- or 5-minute versions of several different lessons instead.</para>
				<para paraID="30">And while Andrew acknowledges that this preparation is equipping him for full-time missionary service, he can also see advantages in his life right now.</para>
				<para paraID="31">“I find myself thinking about things from <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> all the time,” says Andrew. “I am the only Mormon in <pageBreak pageNum="26"/>my high school, so people often ask me questions about what I believe. I’ve been able to use lessons and skills from <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> to tell friends or acquaintances about the gospel.</para>
				<para paraID="32">“There are some questions or conversations that could go a lot of different ways,” he continues, “but when I can steer them in a productive direction because of things I’ve studied, that feels awesome.”</para>
				<para paraID="33">Like Andrew Mello, Andrew Hovey, age 19, received a copy of <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> during his high school years, but it wasn’t until he was a university freshman that he came to appreciate it. Through the influence of a returned-missionary roommate and a mission-preparation class, Andrew began to prepare for his mission more actively than he ever had before. His prayers became more intimate and meaningful, his scripture study became more directed, and his plans for his mission became more real, he says. Moreover, he started using <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> to direct his efforts.</para>
				<para paraID="34">Since then, Andrew has developed a system for marking and color coding his scriptures to coincide with principles he has studied in <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> as well as for recording thoughts and impressions he receives during his study. But he’s quick to acknowledge that the point is not to have a prescriptive way of marking or color coding or note taking. Rather, “you can personalize your study method in a way that fits you best,” he says. “That’s what’s great about the gospel. We’re all different, but the gospel fits all of us.</para>
				<para paraID="35">“It’s the same with <emphasis>Preach My Gospel.</emphasis> It teaches basic doctrines in broad ways so that you can use it as a guide. We can use it the way we need to for our own learning or to reach someone else.”</para>
				<para paraID="36">Patrick Smith, another young man in the Hingham stake, reports that once a month in his branch’s Aaronic Priesthood meetings, the young men report on any missionary experience they have had and then set up times to work with the full-time missionaries.</para>
				<para paraID="37">“Not long ago I went with the missionaries to teach a family who had already been taught the Joseph Smith story,” Patrick says. “The elders asked me to teach about Christ coming to the earth and establishing His Church. <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> clearly illustrated everything and listed scriptures to back everything up. It was all outlined there.</para>
				<para paraID="38">“I knew about these things and had a testimony of them, but <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> and going on exchanges <pageBreak pageNum="27"/>with the missionaries has helped me teach these principles better,” Patrick says. “The doctrines outlined in the book have reinforced what I’ve learned at home and in Primary for as long as I can remember. And the things taught in <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> invite the Spirit, which is the most important thing we can have when we’re talking about the Church.”</para>

			<topic>
				<title paraID="39">In Helping Accomplish Heavenly Father’s Work and Glory</title>
				<para paraID="40">Patrick’s older brother, Tom, returned from the California Ventura Mission in August 2009. He feels that <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> is one of the best tools for missionary work. Although Tom appreciated what the book helped him do as a missionary, he notes that nearly all of the prophetic statements on missionary work appearing on pages 12–13 of <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> talk about the role of <emphasis>members</emphasis> in sharing the gospel. He says that’s indicative of how much missionary work should be done by members and not just by full-time missionaries.</para>
				<para paraID="41">“As I was closing in on the end of my mission,” he recalls, “I was studying about the responsibilities of missionaries and why we—missionaries and members—are given this work to do. I read <scriptureRef book="moses" chapter="1" verse="39">Moses 1:39</scriptureRef> and thought about missionary work from Heavenly Father’s point of view. All He wants is for His children to return to Him. What we’ve been charged with doing, I realized, is helping our Father accomplish His work.</para>
				<para paraID="42">“Now as a member missionary, I know that with regular scripture study (including study of <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis>), prayer, and seeking the Spirit, we can succeed in any endeavor. And if we let the gospel be at the center of our lives and work to better our understanding of it, it will become easier to share and testify.”</para>

			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="29"/>On a cool, misty morning in northeastern Tongatapu, the main island in Tonga, Filimone Tufui Pasi dresses for a day “in the bush”—the Tongan expression referring to working on his farming plot. To get there he will pass through the swampy land surrounding his cinder-block home and then walk beneath the tall coconut trees and among the broad-leaf taro plants.</para>
			<para paraID="6">On this day, however, President Pasi, a counselor in the stake presidency, never makes it to the bush. Members of the Church have come seeking his assistance. A humble man of few words, President Pasi nods quietly, walks back inside his home, and explains the situation to his wife, Ana Malina. She and their daughter will spend this day making tapa cloth to raise money for school and sending the Pasis’ children on missions.</para>
			<para paraID="7">Within a few minutes President Pasi returns to the group, now dressed in a white shirt and tie, prepared to help. The decision will cost him a full day of his livelihood. But the smile of satisfaction on his face, knowing he is doing the Lord’s work, makes up the difference. “I’ve tried to live my life this way,” he says. “I think that’s why the Lord has blessed me so much.”</para>
			<para paraID="8">Such acts of dedication and faithfulness are common among the Tongan Latter-day Saints, who testify that blessings come through faithfully living the gospel.</para>

				<title paraID="9">Faith to Serve</title>
				<para paraID="10">Liola Christine Nau Hingano grew up in the Church, and she often saw the missionaries serving in her community. “I wanted to serve a mission myself,” she says. However, serving would not be easy.</para>
				<para paraID="11">Shortly after Liola submitted her mission papers, she became very sick. The doctors discovered she had a tumor and had to perform surgery to remove it. While she was in the hospital, Liola received her mission call—to serve in Tonga. She had two months to recover before starting her mission, but it was a difficult time for Liola because her parents thought a mission would be too hard on her and didn’t want her to go.</para>
				<para paraID="12">“But I believed that because the Lord had called me, I would be OK, so I decided to go,” she <pageBreak pageNum="30"/>says. “When I entered the missionary training center, the mission president gave me a blessing and said that as I served the Lord, I would be as healthy as any missionary.</para>
				<para paraID="13">“My first mission area was very hard. We walked for miles each day just to get to the area where we were working. We carried our scriptures with us, and the sun was hot. But I knew I would be fine because I had received a priesthood blessing that said so. And I was. I never had trouble because of my previous illness.</para>
				<para paraID="14">“I am very grateful I had the courage to go on a mission and not turn back. It has made such a difference in who I am today—and in my testimony. I have faith in our Savior and Heavenly Father.”</para>

				<title paraID="15">Opening the Windows of Heaven</title>
				<para paraID="16">Just as Liola served faithfully because of her testimony, others have gained that testimony through obedience. Such was the case for ‘Anau Vuna Hala. ‘Anau was baptized as a young boy but became less active almost immediately. Although his sister was an active member of the Church, ‘Anau had no desire to return to church, and for many years he did not.</para>
				<para paraID="17">As a grown man he married Kinakuia (Kina) Hala, a Latter-day Saint. One day he discovered something that troubled him: his wife had begun paying tithing.</para>
				<para paraID="18">“I was disappointed,” ‘Anau says. “I did not make a lot of money as a schoolteacher. I didn’t want her to pay tithing anymore. We argued about it for several years.”</para>
				<para paraID="19">Kina tried everything to convince her husband that paying tithing was a good idea. “She had the home teachers teach us about the principle of tithing,” ‘Anau says. “I received many lessons about tithing, but I still said no.</para>
				<para paraID="20">“Then one day my wife challenged me to observe the law with her and see what would happen. It was a tough decision for me, but I wanted us to find peace, so I said OK.”</para>
				<para paraID="21">Not long after, ‘Anau began noticing little changes taking place in their lives. “When we paid our tithing first and then our bills, we had very little left over,” he explains. “But then we received blessings. Sometimes we’d receive help unexpectedly from family members overseas <pageBreak pageNum="31"/>or help from elsewhere. We always had enough.”</para>
				<para paraID="22">The blessings weren’t just financial. ‘Anau says, “I became active in the Church. We were happier at home. We decided to adopt a baby, even though we knew the food and other needs would be costly. But we knew that if we were faithful and paid tithing, doing what the Lord required, somehow things would work out. I was even able to get a better job working for the Church school, Liahona High School. And we were sealed in the temple.</para>
				<para paraID="23">“We feel our greatest blessings are the peace and joy we feel in knowing that we can cope with our financial difficulties if we pay our tithing. From the moment I accepted that principle, the Lord has blessed my family. I know it to be true.”</para>

				<title paraID="24">The Impact of Our Faith</title>
				<para paraID="25">Kumifonua (Fonua) Taumoepenu found that the strength of conviction may come even after periods of loss and inactivity. Shortly after his baptism in 1995, Fonua served in many positions in the Church. He also worked for a soft drink company and was very successful, rising quickly through the ranks. But he was frequently away from home and found himself slowly moving away from his spiritual convictions. After a time he even began engaging in activities he knew he shouldn’t.</para>
				<para paraID="26">One day Fonua ran into a group of men who, though unprovoked, beat him so badly he had to be taken to the hospital. While there Fonua began to reflect on his life and the poor decisions he had made. “I realized something was wrong with the way I was living,” he says. “My example caused my children to make poor decisions too. They were doing things they shouldn’t do.”</para>
				<para paraID="27">Fonua decided it was time to change. He worked hard to repent, became worthy to <pageBreak pageNum="32"/>enter the temple, and began attending regularly. One evening in the temple, he reflected on his life. “I knew I was worthy to be there,” he says, “but I felt uncomfortable. I looked back on my life and evaluated what I had done. I had not been a good servant of the Lord. And I needed answers too. I wanted a new job that would make it easier to stay clean.”</para>
				<para paraID="28">Fonua had just been offered a well-paying job in New Zealand. His family had encouraged him to take it because such jobs were hard to come by. “But I worried about leaving my family in Tonga and about how I would stay clean living so far away,” he says.</para>
				<para paraID="29">While in the temple, Fonua offered his heart in prayer to Heavenly Father. “I made a commitment to myself and to God that I would do what He wants for me. It was different from any commitment I had ever made before. And I received an answer there in the temple about how I could permanently change my life.”</para>
				<para paraID="30">Instead of taking the job in New Zealand, Fonua decided to stay in Tonga and look for better work. During this time, he was called as a temple worker. As he served faithfully, he says, “the Lord blessed me for righteous choices.” Fonua soon gained a major contract cleaning buildings. “It was a tremendous blessing. I could stay in Tonga with my family, take care of them, and serve in the temple.</para>
				<para paraID="31">“All that I have, all my blessings, come from being a servant of the Lord. I will never forget that moment in the temple. Even my children have been blessed. Before, they had caused a lot of trouble for Church members. But they’ve changed. They participate in church. There’s a great happiness in our home now—all because of the Lord.”</para>

				<title paraID="32">Sacrifice Brings Forth Blessings</title>
				<para paraID="33">For Vaea Tangitau Ta‘ufo‘ou, being a faithful member of the Church has involved significant physical sacrifices. When he joined the Church at age 19, he lived on Foa, one of the outer islands in the Ha‘apai group. One of his first callings was as a leader working with the youth. Like other leaders he often had to attend meetings in Pangai, a town on the next island. To get there he had to walk seven miles (11 km) to the end of the island. Then he would have to wait for low tide so he could walk to the next island through the shallow water—assuming the current wasn’t too strong at the time—and then continue on until he arrived. The trip would take most of the day, and sometimes he would have to wait overnight to return home.</para>
				<para paraID="34">“It was a challenge to make our meetings,” Vaea says. “But it did not discourage us. It strengthened our testimonies.”</para>
				<para paraID="35">Early in his life Vaea hated the Church because of untrue stories spread about it by others in the village. Then his family was befriended by members of the Church. Their good example softened the hearts of Vaea’s family, and his sister was baptized. A year later he joined the Church and was soon serving diligently.</para>
				<para paraID="36">Some years later their district had grown significantly and had the potential to become a stake. Following meetings at Pangai, Vaea and others had to return home. But the district president <pageBreak pageNum="33"/>wanted them to be back for meetings the next morning and asked them to be on time. To make the round trip successfully, Vaea had to run most of the way.</para>
				<para paraID="37">“I was so exhausted I almost felt like dying because the district president had also asked us to fast so we could organize the stake. But I made it. I learned the importance of making it to our meetings and being on time despite the challenges. I believe my calling as bishop shortly after this was because I was willing to make the sacrifice to serve and be obedient. I also believe our fasting made a difference. Not long after, President Howard<nb/>W. Hunter [1907–95] came and organized the stake.”</para>
				<para paraID="38">Perhaps the largest challenge for Vaea, however, was getting to the temple to be sealed. He and his girlfriend had decided to get married, and they both wanted to get married in the temple. But the closest temple at the time was in New Zealand, and the cost of getting there was tremendous.</para>
				<para paraID="39">“For a whole year we fasted together every Tuesday to find a way to make it to the temple. She was still living on an island in the north; I was in Ha‘apai. It was difficult. But then two businessmen heard our story, and they felt inspired to help. They actually paid for our trip. They said that if we truly wanted to be married in the temple, they would provide the way. I did not have any property or even a job so I could pay them back, but they did not want anything. It was a tremendous blessing.”</para>

				<title paraID="40">Blessings of Living the Gospel</title>
				<para paraID="41">Just as the taro plants and coconut trees nourish those who tend them, these Tongan Saints have learned that the Lord blesses those who serve Him. And just as the waves lap continuously upon the Tongan shores, the Lord is a constant factor in these members’ lives. Whether it be through repentance or tithing or simple, daily commitments, they have discovered peace, comfort, and happiness as they have dedicated themselves to the service of the Lord. And they testify that such blessings are available to all who make the same commitment (see <scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="2" verse="24,41">Mosiah 2:24, 41</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="130" verse="20-21">D&amp;C 130:20–21</scriptureRef>).</para>

Born in Tonga and raised in Hawaii, he stopped going to church when he was old enough to make his own decisions. Part of his problem, he says, was so-called friends who encouraged him into forbidden paths. Soon Sione had gotten into so much trouble he had to return to Tonga.</para>

				<para paraID="13">Relief Society is the largest women’s organization in the world. The fact that it works under priesthood direction makes it completely unique. It allows our worldwide Relief Society to work in all cultures.</para>
				<para paraID="14">Every bishop or branch president has the responsibility for his specific unit. Each Relief Society president is called to <pageBreak pageNum="36"/>assist one bishop or branch president. Each priesthood leader and Relief Society presidency member has been set apart and blessed to receive inspiration for his or her particular responsibilities—and not for any other ward or branch or group of Relief Society sisters. As a result, all Relief Societies—whether in Chile, Hong Kong, Ghana, or elsewhere—can each plan what their sisters specifically need.</para>
				<para paraID="15">Following are examples of how two Relief Society presidents worked in partnership with their bishops:</para>
				<para paraID="16">A Relief Society presidency in Pleasant Grove, Utah, met with their bishop to discuss ward goals before planning Relief Society classes. Based on those goals, Relief Society leaders planned a meeting where a sister in the ward shared how she uses <emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> for family home evening. They also arranged several gardening workshops, including how to store food from one’s garden. Of the presidency’s meetings with the bishop, the Relief Society president says, “We feel our bishop’s love, knowing he is praying to the Lord in our behalf.”</para>
				<para paraID="17">A Relief Society president in Lehi, Utah, using information from <urlRef urlPath="http://www.reliefsociety.lds.org">reliefsociety.lds.org</urlRef>, proposed six months of meetings to the bishop. She says, “I encouraged my counselor to train our Relief Society meeting coordinator to focus on the purposes of Relief Society as they planned our monthly classes. When they met with the Relief Society committee members, they asked them to pray about how we could use the purposes of Relief Society to help meet the needs in our ward. The committee came back with many ideas. Then with the bishop’s input and approval, we finalized our plans.”</para>

And only He truly knows what will best help them. Thus, our solution is to ask in faith for direction.”</para>
				<para paraID="20">The purpose of Relief Society will take on a new strength for Relief Society leaders, the sisters, and their families.

					<para paraID="4">I had lived in Thailand for about four months as a community service volunteer, and although I could speak basic Thai, I still had a lot to learn. I had just changed areas, but my new host family already understood that I was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I did my best to explain my values and even gave the family a Thai Book of Mormon and a <emphasis>For the Strength of Youth</emphasis> pamphlet.</para>
					<para paraID="5">As I waited for my host father to come home, I sat on the living room floor and began studying a Thai phrase book. Suddenly, a strong impression came to me to invite him to pray with me. It had occurred to me before to ask him, but the impression had never come so powerfully. During my time in Thailand, I had shared the gospel on many occasions, but I had never asked anyone to pray with me.</para>
					<para paraID="6">My host father and I had a good relationship. I even called him “Dad,” which he seemed to appreciate. I felt excited and then nervous. What if he told me no? What if he felt uncomfortable around me for the rest of my time with his family? Should I chance ruining our relationship? To make matters worse, I didn’t know how to pray in Thai. I didn’t even know enough Thai to ask my host father to pray, so I asked my Heavenly Father for help.</para>
					<para paraID="7">Shortly afterward, I heard a loud clang as the front gate closed. As my host father entered, he greeted me and announced that he was going to bed. I realized that I couldn’t let this opportunity pass. As I opened my mouth to speak, I immediately knew what to say and how to say it in Thai.</para>
					<para paraID="8">“Dad, in America I used to pray with my family, and I really miss doing so. Would you pray with me?” I was surprised by his response.</para>
					<para paraID="9">“Jon,” he replied, “of course I would. Teach me how.”</para>
					<para paraID="10">I then explained in Thai what prayer is but decided to say my prayer in English. I knew God was listening, and I knew my host father felt the Spirit. My eyes welled with tears as he followed the conclusion of my prayer with “amen.”</para>
					<para paraID="11">I can’t express in words the joy and love I felt for my host father and my Heavenly Father. That experience gave me confidence and led to more experiences in sharing the gospel with others. Unfortunately, my host family never accepted my invitation to attend the local branch, but I know that the knowledge I shared with them will benefit them sooner or later.</para>
					<para paraID="12">Though we may not always see the fruits of our labors in this life, I learned that planting gospel seeds can bless at least one life—your own. And in the Lord’s time, those seeds may bless the lives of others.</para>

					<para paraID="4">Because our son was so premature, there was not much chance he would survive. Our doctor asked us if we really wanted physicians to help him, thus prolonging the inevitable. I answered that as long as he was alive, we had to give him a chance. Then I asked God for a miracle.</para>
					<para paraID="5">Iñaki received a blessing of health that first night. During the next four long months, he suffered a perforation in his intestines, a brain hemorrhage, and a collapsed lung. Because of his circumstances, we received permission to give him a name and a blessing in the hospital.</para>
					<para paraID="6">Throughout this process, we met other parents who suffered just as we did, and we offered each other support and comfort. We also shared our testimonies of the gospel with everyone we could.</para>
					<para paraID="7">One day we received a call to go to the hospital to say good-bye to our son, who was not expected to survive through the afternoon. When we arrived, we held him and spoke to him. Seeing him in his weak condition was indescribably painful. For the first time, my husband and I realized that we were just temporary guardians for this child of God. All we could do to help him was pray and ask Heavenly Father for His will to be done. Iñaki clung to life that afternoon, and we are grateful that he continued to do so in the days that followed.</para>
					<para paraID="8">During the four months Iñaki spent in the neonatal intensive-care unit, we repeatedly saw the power of the priesthood in action as Heavenly Father blessed our son through the hands of physicians and priesthood holders—eventually healing him, to the amazement of the doctors.</para>
					<para paraID="9">In October 2008, Iñaki came home.</para>
					<para paraID="10">We have learned many things as a family through this experience. We know that our Heavenly Father loves us and that He works miracles and preserves His Saints despite the trials we must endure. And we understand better the purpose of eternal families, the important role they play in the plan of happiness, and how generous our Heavenly Father is with His children.</para>

The leaders of the branch there had not only prayed and fasted that missionaries would return, but they had also prepared for that day.</para>
					<para paraID="4">When I arrived, every family in the branch had friends who were ready to receive the missionaries. One member introduced us to a lady named Ana Oviedo, who sold fruit and homemade food on one of the busiest street corners in the city. While she was there selling food one Saturday morning, we asked if we could visit her at her home and share a message about Jesus Christ. She accepted.</para>
					<para paraID="5">When we arrived that night, Ana and her four children were waiting for us. We introduced ourselves and started teaching them. We felt inspired to teach about the blessings of keeping the Sabbath day holy. We also taught the family about tithing and the promises made by the prophet Malachi (see <scriptureRef book="mal" chapter="3" verse="10-12">Malachi 3:10–12</scriptureRef>).</para>
					<para paraID="6">In response, Ana told us that she had already prepared to sell food the next day—Sunday—just as she always did. We then offered a prayer, asking Heavenly Father to bless this poor family, which needed the mother’s income.</para>
					<para paraID="7">The following day we were surprised to see her come to church with her children. We welcomed them and asked her what had happened with the food she had prepared to sell.</para>

She said she had been selling food on that corner her whole life—Monday through Sunday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.—and that she always had leftover items that didn’t sell. But that Monday she had sold all of her food by 1:00 p.m.</para>
					<para paraID="11">Heavenly Father had answered our prayers. The Lord continued to bless Ana, and she no longer needed to sell food on the Sabbath. Her children were soon baptized, but Ana’s husband would not consent to her baptism. Nevertheless, she remained faithful to the gospel and attended church until the day she died.</para>

Each morning he would leave with another engineer to continue the work of the previous day. His work was difficult because the coast was heavily forested.</para>

He worked each day along the coast, but I had no idea where he was working that day. I felt impelled to get in the car and drive to the main highway, but in which direction should I turn? With only slight hesitation, I felt that I should turn south. I then passed many side roads, any one of which could have been the area of Jim’s work.</para>

				<para paraID="7"><pageBreak pageNum="42"/>I have learned from many conversations with returned missionaries that the adjustment associated with leaving the mission field and returning to the world you left behind is sometimes difficult. May I offer just a few suggestions?</para>
				<topic>
					<title paraID="8">Frequent, Consistent, and Mighty Prayer</title>
					<para paraID="9">One of the strongest recollections I have of being a missionary is how close I drew to the Lord through the practice of regular prayer. In my day the mission home was located on State Street in Salt Lake City. It was a large house that had been converted to a missionary training center. It had large dormitory rooms with perhaps as many as 10 beds in a room. We checked in on Sunday night.</para>
					<para paraID="10">The week before I entered the mission field was an exciting time. There were a lot of parties and farewells. I am afraid that I was not properly rested and prepared for the training I was to receive at the mission home. As the evening of our first day in the mission home came to a close, I was weary. While waiting for the other missionaries to prepare themselves for bed, I stretched out on my bed and promptly fell asleep. My sleep, however, was interrupted by a feeling that I was surrounded. As the fog of sleep lifted, I heard the words of a prayer being said. I opened my eyes, and much to my surprise I found all the elders in my dormitory room kneeling around my bed, concluding the day with a prayer. I quickly closed my eyes and acted as if I was asleep. I was too embarrassed to get out of bed and join them. Even though my first experience with prayer as a missionary was an embarrassing one, it was the beginning of two wonderful years of frequently calling upon the Lord for guidance.</para>
					<para paraID="11">Throughout my mission, I prayed with my companion each morning as we began a new day. The process was repeated each night before we retired. We offered a prayer before we studied, a prayer as we left our apartment to go out tracting, and of course special prayers when special guidance was needed to direct our missionary work. The frequency of our appeals to our Father in Heaven gave us strength and courage to press forward in the work to which we had been called. Answers would come, sometimes in astonishingly direct and positive ways. The guidance of the Holy Spirit seemed to be magnified the more times we appealed to Heavenly Father for direction on a given day.</para>
					<para paraID="12">As I look back on my life following my mission, I realize that there were periods when I was able to maintain the same closeness to the Lord that I experienced in the mission field. There were also periods when the world seemed to creep in and I was less consistent and faithful with my prayers.</para>
					<para paraID="13">Wouldn’t this be a good time for a little self-evaluation to determine if we still have the same relationship with our Father in Heaven that we enjoyed in the mission field? If the world has diverted us from the practice of prayer, we then have lost a great spiritual power. Maybe it is time that we rekindle our missionary spirit through more frequent, consistent, and mighty prayer.</para>

				<topic>
					<title paraID="14">Individual and Companion Scripture Study</title>
					<para paraID="15"><pageBreak pageNum="43"/>The next fond memory I have of being a missionary is that of daily engaging in scripture study. The discipline of following a scripture-study plan of learning the gospel was a wonderful, rewarding experience. The knowledge of the teachings of the scriptures would unfold in a glorious way through individual study. As a missionary I recall marveling at how completely the Lord had prepared a plan for His children here on earth, how in all dispensations of time He has inspired the minds of His prophets to record His dealings with them. His words are always positive and direct, revealing the blessings that come through following His law and His way.</para>
					<para paraID="16">We would also take an hour or more each day to study as companions together. Having two sets of eyes examine the doctrine of the kingdom seemed to multiply our understanding. We would read together, then share our insights.</para>
					<para paraID="17">Our minds were sharpened as we followed the daily practice of individual and companion study. The practice brought us closer together as companions and increased our understanding of the doctrines of the kingdom.</para>

As we return home, how great it would be to hold daily family scripture study. If we leave home, couldn’t we invite roommates and friends to study with us? The practice of holding regular study classes and attending institute would help keep the doctrines of the kingdom clear in our minds and offset the persistent intrusion of worldly concerns. Of course, when we marry, we have eternal companions with whom we can study and share gospel teachings.</para>

					<title paraID="20">The Joy of Teaching the Gospel</title>
					<para paraID="21">Do you remember the joy that comes from teaching the gospel to someone who has been deprived of these teachings throughout his or her life, the excitement that comes when you teach the law of the Lord, and the <pageBreak pageNum="44"/>blessings that are received from following Him? Could you ever forget the joy of your first baptism in the mission field?</para>
					<para paraID="22">In my day the chapels were not equipped with baptismal fonts. My first baptism was in the Scioto River in the state of Ohio, USA. It was on a cool fall day, and the water seemed even colder than the air. I remember the shock of wading into the cold river while encouraging my investigator to follow me. The coldness of the air and the water, however, soon vanished as I administered the ordinance of baptism. Seeing the radiant face of the individual who came up out of the waters of baptism is an image I will never forget.</para>
					<para paraID="23">Opportunities to teach the gospel and baptize are not exclusive to those who wear the badge of a full-time missionary. I wonder why we allow the fire of missionary service to diminish when we return to the activities of our life in the world.</para>
					<para paraID="24">There has never been a time in the history of mankind when we have been better equipped to teach the gospel to our Father in Heaven’s children here on earth. And they seem to need it more today than they ever have. We see a deterioration of faith. We see an increased love for worldliness and a depletion of moral values, both of which will cause increased heartache and despair. What we need is a royal army of returned missionaries reenlisted into service. While they would not wear the badge of a full-time missionary, they could possess the same resolve and determination to bring the light of the gospel to a world struggling to find its way.</para>
					<para paraID="25">I call on you returned missionaries to rededicate yourselves, to become reinfused with the desire and spirit of missionary service. I call on you to look the part, to be the part, and to act the part of a servant of our Father in Heaven. I pray for your renewed determination to proclaim the gospel that you may become more actively engaged in this great work the Lord has called all of us to do. I want to promise you there are great blessings in store for you if you continue to press forward with the zeal you once possessed as a full-time missionary.</para>
					<para paraID="26">Go forward with new determination, and through your example, let shine the light of the gospel in this troubled world. This is the Lord’s work in which we are engaged. God lives. Jesus is the Christ. We belong to His Church. This is my witness to you.</para>

				<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="45"/>It did not take long for me to realize that my mission was going to be very different than I had expected. I was faced with some unexpected challenges. I tried to stay positive, but my attempts often failed, leaving me feeling discouraged. Thankfully, I received encouragement at zone conferences, which always concluded with a testimony meeting.</para>
				<para paraID="6">I remember one particular zone conference when each missionary took the stand, expressing the joy of serving a mission. As the meeting progressed, I began to feel uncomfortable. I had been a missionary for a full year but had never felt the joy others were describing. I left that conference heavyhearted and confused, questioning why I was even serving a mission. What was wrong with me? Why couldn’t I feel that same joy? Later that night I expressed my concerns to Heavenly Father and asked Him how I could feel such joy.</para>
				<para paraID="7">Several weeks later, while attending stake conference, I received my answer during a talk by my mission president. Although he spoke to the hundreds in the audience, I felt that he spoke directly to me. He talked about the joy of Christ’s Redemption that each of us can feel every day. He testified that even during difficult and uncertain times, we can feel joy from understanding the significance of the Savior’s Atonement.</para>
				<para paraID="8">I knew those words were for me. Heavenly Father had answered my prayer. Perhaps my mission was not going as I had thought it would, but the Savior loved me and had atoned for my sins. The joy I thought I had never experienced was all around me. I just hadn’t opened my heart to feel it.</para>
				<para paraID="9">My challenges continued, but this experience taught me that I could feel joy by choosing to open my heart to the Savior’s redeeming power and by sharing my testimony of that power with others.</para>
				<para paraID="10">Since my mission I have come to understand that situations and surroundings have no lasting impact on our ability to feel joy. Instead, true joy comes from obeying and believing in Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, who made life here—and hereafter—“that [we] might have joy” (<scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="2" verse="25">2<nb/>Nephi 2:25</scriptureRef>).</para>

Before you go, pray to have the Spirit with you. Then enjoy the opportunity to expand your knowledge of different religions and, at the same time, understand more about your own.</para>

				<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="48"/>I grew up in an active Latter-day Saint family in England, the eighth of 10 children. Our faithful parents taught us the gospel and set good examples. But at about age 14, I began to find it difficult to attend early-morning seminary, go to various classes and firesides, and attend youth activities. Most of my friends were not members of the Church and had very different standards from the ones I was raised with.</para>
				<para paraID="6">I began to make bad decisions because I wanted so much to be like my friends and have the so-called fun they were having. By the time I was 15, I was completely inactive in the Church. As I became older, my life grew even more worldly.</para>
				<para paraID="7">At the same time, however, I began to feel something deep down in my soul. Questions about the purpose of life and the destiny of man started to fill my mind. The world I once knew and thought I loved had become a very dark, cold, and lonely place. My soul was not fully satisfied with what the world had to offer. I had a feeling that I should be somewhere other than my hometown, a feeling that I was meant to do something else with my life.</para>
				<para paraID="8">After many weeks of these feelings and thoughts, I decided to pray and ask for help, the first time I had prayed in a long while. I decided to wait until night, when everyone was asleep. After my prayer, I thought and listened, but there was nothing. I continued in this way for weeks until it hit me: perhaps God would not answer me straight away simply because I had been raised in the gospel and unfortunately I had never seriously appreciated it.</para>
				<para paraID="9">One evening I changed my method. Instead of demanding an answer and expecting the Lord to give it straight away, I promised the Lord that if He would answer, I would serve Him as a missionary. For the first time, I prayed to know if the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith, and the Church teachings were true. I felt something so powerful yet so <pageBreak pageNum="50"/>peaceful that it caused me to weep.</para>
				<para paraID="10">I went to my bishop, who happened to be my eldest brother, and asked to serve a mission. I was nervous, but I knew that because the Lord had kept His end of the deal, I had to keep mine. Tears streamed down my bishop’s face as I related my experience.</para>
				<para paraID="11">Then I began dating Kelly, a friend who was not a member of the Church. I related to her my plans to serve a mission. Kelly saw that I had changed and wondered why. This led to Kelly’s having the missionary lessons and joining the Church, and I had the opportunity to baptize and confirm her. At this point I wondered if that missionary effort had fulfilled my service to the Lord. I wrestled with having to go, and I was determined to pray to find out if leaving Kelly and serving a mission was the right thing to do.</para>
				<para paraID="12">I chose a place in the hills on the moors called Saddleworth Dovestones, where I would not be disturbed. I took my lunch, scriptures, and my journal and headed out, climbing to the top to offer the desires of my heart to my Father in Heaven. As I prayed, I listened very carefully for an answer, maybe a peaceful feeling or a burning in my bosom, but I felt nothing.</para>
				<para paraID="13">As I walked back, I noticed a series of rocks on the ground carefully placed to spell out the words “Truth Will Prevail.” “Curious,” I thought, but nothing more. However, when I told my mother, she said simply, “That’s your answer.”</para>
				<para paraID="14">You see, when the Latter-day Saint missionaries first came to England in 1837, they began their labors in Preston. At that time the city was in the midst of a grand celebration of Queen Victoria’s reign. As the missionaries alighted from their coach, they saw a banner overhead proclaiming in bold gilt letters “Truth Will Prevail.”</para>
				<para paraID="15">It became a widely-used phrase in the Church and appeared in various publications. One elder, reporting on his mission to Indiana, wrote in a letter published in Nauvoo’s <emphasis>Times and Seasons</emphasis>in 1841: “Although the Lord has chosen the weak things of this world to preach his gospel, truth will prevail, and will prosper.”<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="16">Trusting the Lord, I turned in my mission papers. On my 21st birthday, along with my birthday post, came my call to serve in the England London South Mission. Due to my years of inactivity, I still felt weak and inadequate. Only later would I understand what that early missionary understood: the Lord may choose the weak things of this world to preach His gospel, but truth <emphasis>will</emphasis> prevail and <emphasis>will</emphasis> prosper.</para>
				<para paraID="17">I went in faith to the temple to be endowed. When I came out of the temple, I met two missionaries who had served in my home ward. As we talked, I described my experience out on the moors. One of the elders smiled broadly and explained that on a particular preparation day, he and his companion had hiked up on the moors and at a certain point felt impressed to place some rocks across the hillside spelling out the familiar phrase “Truth Will Prevail.”</para>
				<para paraID="18">Tears streamed down our faces as we realized what had happened. Those familiar with the area know there are miles and miles of trails amongst the moors. Yet I happened to choose the very spot where the missionaries had placed those rocks. I knew there and then that the Lord had answered my prayer in the hills that day.</para>

					<para paraID="13">When I went to youth conference one year, I had no idea of the impact it would have on me. We had three days packed full of fun activities, and I was excited to see old friends, meet new ones, and get involved. But my favorite part was the testimony meeting. The Spirit was strong as we bore our testimonies of the gospel, and many of us were moved to tears. For me this beautiful feeling lasted for days after the conference, and I wanted it to stay. I didn’t even watch TV or listen to non-Church music. This experience truly strengthened my testimony of the Church.</para>

When we live with the Spirit, we can feel His warmth and know the Church is true. I love the gospel; it has answers and direction. I wish that everyone in the world could know what we know.</para>

				<kicker paraID="4">He was on a scooter, waiting for the light. I had only seconds to talk to him.</kicker>
			</titleBlock>
			<bodyBlock>
				<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="52"/>As my missionary companion, Elder Platt, and I were walking through a market in the streets of Taichung, Taiwan, we stopped at a main intersection and waited at the red light. Just after stopping, I heard a familiar sound behind us. As several scooters pulled up beside us, I turned to see who we could talk to. At that moment, a distinct impression filled my heart and my mind. No voice was spoken, no words were uttered, but I felt impressed that I needed to talk to the man on the scooter just a few steps to my left.</para>
				<para paraID="6">I moved with a sense of urgency to speak with the man. It felt as if someone was actually pushing me from behind and moving my feet for me. I opened my mouth and asked the man, “Are you having a good day today?” He looked at me and responded that he was having a bad day. At that instant the stoplight turned from red to green, and my heart fell. I was afraid the man would drive away. I had said nothing to him of the Restoration of the true and living Church of Jesus Christ, of the Prophet Joseph Smith, or of the Book of Mormon. I had not even told him the name of the Church.</para>
				<para paraID="7">The people around us began to drive off, but the man did not. He suggested that we move to the side of the road to talk more. I was shocked, but I gratefully complied with his suggestion. At the side of the road, Elder Platt and I shared with him the name of the Church and much more.</para>
				<para paraID="8">A few weeks later, that man, Su Meng-Wei, and his two sons and two daughters were baptized and confirmed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</para>
				<para paraID="9">From that experience, I learned that as we faithfully strive to do the Lord’s work in His way and on His timetable, we are sometimes privileged to witness miracles. The prophet Moroni declared that “God has not ceased to be a God of miracles. Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in our eyes?” (<scriptureRef book="morm" chapter="9" verse="15-16">Mormon 9:15–16</scriptureRef>). Miracles can come with the touching of hearts and the changing of lives.</para>
				<para paraID="10"><emphasis>Preach My Gospel</emphasis> contains this promise to missionaries and members of the Church: “The Lord is preparing people to receive you and the restored gospel. He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. … Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message.”<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker> It was no accident that Elder Platt and I were at that specific stoplight at that exact time.</para>
				<para paraID="11">Heavenly Father knows and loves each of us individually. In no coincidental way, He provides a way for all of us to come to a knowledge of the restored gospel. The Lord was mindful of the challenges and difficulties in Su Meng-Wei’s life. He knew that Su Meng-Wei had recently become unemployed. He knew that contentious words had been spoken in the Su house that morning.</para>
				<para paraID="12">The gospel has brought more peace to the Su family and has strengthened their family relationships. <pageBreak pageNum="53"/>It has helped them find greater happiness and direction in life. They have found the power to face life’s challenges with hope and without fear.</para>
				<para paraID="13">We may not see it at first, but those who have been prepared will recognize that we are the Lord’s servants. They will notice something different about us. They will see goodness and will want to know more about it. As they feel the Holy Ghost, they will be willing to act on our message. Just as this message has touched the hearts and changed the lives of the Su family in Taiwan, so it can and will touch the hearts and change the lives of those we know, wherever in the world we may be.</para>
				<para paraID="14">Praying for guidance, we can daily ask ourselves this question: whom do I know that the Lord is preparing to come to a knowledge of the restored gospel? Exercising our faith in this way, we will be ready to follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost and open our mouths to share the precious truths we are blessed to know.</para>
				<para paraID="15">Marvelous opportunities are sure to follow.</para>

				<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="54"/>Basketball is one of the most important things in the life of Roger Enrique Velasquez Paredes, who goes by Koki because it’s much easier to say when the clock is running down and the game is on the line.</para>
				<para paraID="6">Koki, a member of the Victoria Ward, Puno Peru Central Stake, is a starting forward on the Benson Jazz under-17 boys’ team, a community league team sponsored by Church members in Puno, Peru. Koki’s team went undefeated going into the championship game each of the last two seasons and took second both years.</para>
				<para paraID="7">His experience on the team has taught Koki not only a lot about basketball but also a lot about living the gospel and making seminary worthwhile.</para>
				<para paraID="8">“Seminary and basketball aren’t so different,” he says, then laughs. “I have to wake up early for both.”</para>
				<para paraID="9">Joking aside, Koki <emphasis>does</emphasis> see some important similarities between the game he loves and the gospel he lives: you have to listen to the coach, apply what he’s teaching, and not stop practicing what you’ve learned.</para>
				<topic>
					<title paraID="10">Hearken unto Thy Coach</title>
					<para paraID="11">Koki says his coach is great, but it doesn’t matter how good your coach is if you don’t listen. Seminary is no different.</para>
					<para paraID="12">“In both basketball and seminary, I have a good coach,” Koki says. “But if I don’t listen, I don’t get any better.”</para>
					<para paraID="13">A coach tries to teach a player things that will make him or her better, like how to shoot. “The teacher is doing the same thing,” Koki says. Among other things, teachers try to help students succeed against their opponent in life. “They try to teach us how to leave the world and strengthen us against temptation.”</para>
					<para paraID="14"><pageBreak pageNum="56"/>Koki has learned that just showing up, whether in basketball practice or at seminary and church, isn’t enough to make you better. You have to listen to the coach.</para>
				</topic>
				<topic>
					<title paraID="15">Practice What Is Preached</title>
					<para paraID="16">Koki tries to listen while the coach is explaining something new. But he has learned that if he really wants to understand what the coach is saying, he’ll have to put it into practice.</para>
					<para paraID="17">Putting something into practice, or applying it, is an important part of learning, Koki says. A coach can talk all day long about good shooting form and even demonstrate over and over, but until you practice doing what he says, you won’t have learned how to do it yourself.</para>
					<para paraID="18">“That’s how I learned about prayer,” Koki says. He had been taught that consistent personal prayer would invite the Lord’s help. “But it was only after I tried it that I found it was true.”</para>
					<para paraID="19">Putting gospel principles into practice gives the Holy Ghost an opportunity to testify to us that the principle is true.</para>
					<para paraID="20">“If we learn something new but don’t apply it, it’s like we never really learned it,” Koki says.</para>
				</topic>
				<topic>
					<title paraID="21">Use It or Lose It</title>
					<para paraID="22">Koki listened when his coach taught about shooting, and he tried to apply what he learned. Now, in order to improve, Koki has to be diligent in practicing.</para>
					<para paraID="23">Diligence means dedication or persistence in applying what you’ve learned even in the face of opposition.</para>
					<para paraID="24">“I have to be dedicated,” Koki says. “If I stop training, my skills will get rusty.”</para>
					<para paraID="25">That’s an important lesson he learned after he couldn’t practice for a while because he broke his nose in a rough pickup game with some older players.</para>
					<para paraID="26">“If we don’t practice, we don’t just stop progressing—we lose ground,” Koki says. “It’s the same spiritually. If we pay attention and apply what we learn, we can learn more. If not, we lose what we have.”</para>
				</topic>
				<topic>
					<title paraID="27">Don’t Give Up</title>
					<para paraID="28">Koki’s teammates have done their best to listen to the coach and apply what he’s taught them. They practice for hours to keep what they’ve learned.</para>
					<para paraID="29">They’ve also learned that after all of that, it is possible—and disappointing—to fall short of perfection. “We worked hard,” Koki says. “It was discouraging to lose the championship again.”</para>
					<para paraID="30">But while immediate perfection isn’t guaranteed, it would be impossible if they gave up trying. In the meantime, Koki has seen that there are many rewards, including improvement and progress, that come from trying.</para>
					<para paraID="31">Koki, who is serving as a ward missionary, has seen rewards for being diligent off the court as well. He helped organize movie nights, campouts, and sports activities in order to interest two young men in his ward who hadn’t attended church for some time. “At first we’d have to go get them, or they wouldn’t come,” he says. “Now they come on their own. It took a little time and a lot of visits, but they’re coming regularly now.”</para>
					<para paraID="32">Between playing basketball, going to seminary, and serving in the Church, Koki is learning what King Benjamin meant when he said we must be diligent to “win the prize” (<scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="4" verse="27">Mosiah 4:27</scriptureRef>).</para>
					<para paraID="33">He’s also learning that both on the court and off, the rewards are worth the work.</para>

				<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="58"/>Emma Hale was born on July 10, 1804. She lived on a farm with her father and mother and her eight brothers and sisters. Some of her aunts, uncles, and cousins lived nearby.</para>
				<para paraID="6">The Hale farm was in Harmony, Pennsylvania, in a beautiful valley along the bank of the Susquehanna River. Emma could pick apples from the orchard. She could watch baby lambs play, and she could help gather vegetables from the big garden. When the snow started to melt, she could watch her father collect maple sap in big buckets. She could help her mother boil the sap until it finally turned into maple sugar.</para>
				<para paraID="7">When she was a baby, Emma was baptized into a Christian church, and she went to Sunday School when she was a girl. The Church of Jesus Christ had not been restored yet.</para>
				<para paraID="8">One day when Emma was about eight years old, she went to pray in the woods. She was worried about her father because he did not have a strong faith in Jesus Christ. While Emma was praying, her father came into the woods to go hunting. When he overheard his young daughter praying for him, he was very touched. His faith in the Lord was strengthened.</para>
				<para paraID="9">Emma grew to be a tall, intelligent girl. She was an excellent reader and writer. When she was 21, a hardworking and intelligent young man named Joseph Smith came to live at the Hale home. Emma Hale had a good character and a quick wit. She was a virtuous young woman. No wonder she and Joseph chose each other as husband and wife!</para>

I saw some shiny red bicycles, and I wished I could have one to make my deliveries. But I needed a heavy-duty bicycle to pull the cart with the laundry on it. I rode around pulling that heavy laundry cart before school and after school. It was hard seeing the other children play. But everyone in our family had to work hard, and I was an important part of the family business.</para>

When I was very little, I came down with a lung disease, but no one knew it at the time. When I grew older, I joined the air force. The doctors saw spots on my lungs. Because of the hard work of pedaling that heavy load, somehow my body had healed itself. I had built up endurance. I had built up strength. The doctors said that the disease took care of itself and that I passed my physical. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to become a pilot.</para>
				<para paraID="7">As a pilot, I flew all over the world. I never tired of looking at the stars, the clouds, the landscapes. I saw the beauty of the different countries with their different cultures. I know from going to those places and seeing the people and seeing the Church in those different places that the gospel is for everyone, no matter what nation you live in or what your traditions are. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The word of God—whether it is written in the scriptures or spoken by the living prophets, whether we read it in Church magazines or hear it at general conferences—is for everyone.</para>

				<para paraID="5">Daniel’s friends—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego—would not eat the king’s food either. The four Hebrew boys had been captured in Jerusalem and taken to the city of Babylon. Now King Nebuchadnezzar wanted them to eat rich food and wine. He thought it would make them strong.</para>
				<para paraID="6">But Daniel and his friends knew the king’s food would not make them healthy and strong. “Give us pulse to eat and water to drink,” Daniel said to the king’s servant. “After 10 days, compare us to people who eat the king’s rich food.” The servant agreed.</para>

				<para paraID="9">When King Darius became the new king of Babylon, he made wise Daniel a president in his kingdom. Some men were jealous of Daniel.

				<para paraID="11">King Darius was dismayed when the men told him about Daniel. He wished he had not signed the law, but the law had to be obeyed. Daniel was thrown into the lions’ den, and a large stone was placed to cover the entrance.</para>
				<para paraID="12">All that night the king worried and wondered. Early the next morning he hurried to the lions’ den. In a loud voice the king called out, “O Daniel, was thy God able to deliver thee from the lions?”</para>

				<para paraID="6">The missionaries had taught Sophie’s family about Jesus Christ and His Church. Just two weeks ago Elder Kraig and his new companion, Elder Jessen, had baptized Sophie, her parents, and her two older brothers. Already, Sophie felt the difference in their family. There was more laughing, singing, and praying.</para>

				<para paraID="10">Papa opened the box and pulled out six white Sunday shirts. For a long moment he was silent. “We cannot accept so fine a gift,” he said at last.</para>
				<para paraID="11">Sophie heard the regret in Papa’s voice. Their family did not have white shirts for Papa and the boys, and Sophie knew Papa wanted to show respect by dressing in white shirts when they went to church.</para>
				<para paraID="12">“I will not need so many shirts when I go home,” Elder Kraig said. “You will be doing me a favor by keeping them.”</para>
				<para paraID="13">“But I have nothing for you,” Papa said. He pointed to the Book of Mormon. “You have already given us the most precious gift. You brought us the gospel of Jesus Christ.”</para>
				<para paraID="14">The next day Sophie decided to make something for Elder Kraig. After talking with Mama, she decided to make a small woven blanket called a serape. She borrowed her mother’s loom, chose the colors of yarn, and worked on it each day after school and chores. When her fingers fumbled, she carefully undid the strands and started over.</para>

				<para paraID="3"><pageBreak pageNum="74"/>The Gospels are filled with accounts of the Savior healing the sick, the blind, and the lame. Also abundant in the scriptures is the Lord’s invitation to follow Him, to do His works, and to become as He is. Doing so requires that we too have compassion—that we seek to bless and to heal, to lift burdens, and to ease pain and suffering.</para>
				<para paraID="4">This seeking is the driving principle behind the Church’s humanitarian efforts around the world—efforts that are funded largely by the freewill offerings of Church members with the same desire.</para>
				<para paraID="5">In recent years millions of people in more than 100 countries have been blessed by Church humanitarian initiatives that bring clean water to remote villages, provide mobility to those who cannot walk, help prevent or treat blindness, save the lives of struggling newborns, immunize against disease, and help improve crop yields and nutrition.</para>
				<topic>
					<title paraID="6">Clean Water</title>
					<para paraID="7">Water for drinking, cooking, hygiene, and irrigation is scarce in many parts of the world. Often it is gathered a few gallons at a time from rivers, ponds, or shallow wells contaminated with parasites and disease. Time spent obtaining water keeps many adults from more productive activities that could help feed a family.</para>
					<para paraID="8">Those involved in the Church’s clean water projects not only provide safe water systems but also construct sanitation facilities and teach basic hygiene practices. Depending on local conditions, the clean water may come from a new borehole well sunk into an aquifer, from a hand-dug well that is lined and covered, or from springwater that is captured and piped to a community.</para>
					<para paraID="9">Local contractors complete the projects using labor donated by those who will receive the water. Local water committees manage the systems, which are designed to be sustainable for generations. Matt Heaps, manager of the clean water initiative, said, “In reality, our projects are more about people than water systems. Everything is done with an eye to helping individuals and communities become self-sustaining.”</para>
					<para paraID="10">Since 2002, 235 projects in 54 countries have brought clean water to more than five million people.</para>

					<title paraID="11">The Gift of Mobility</title>
					<para paraID="12">For those unable to move about freely on their own, receiving a wheelchair, a walker, <pageBreak pageNum="75"/>or a prosthetic limb is like being given wings. Education, work, church attendance, socializing, and serving others all suddenly become possible.</para>
					<para paraID="13">Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, even the most basic mobility devices are unavailable or unaffordable. By providing such equipment, Latter-day Saint Charities removes a physical barrier that keeps many people from reaching their potential. By partnering with local organizations and buying from regional manufacturers where possible, the wheelchair initiative ensures that recipients have the equipment that best meets their needs. It also helps to ensure that those who get a wheelchair can get follow-up therapy and that parts and knowledgeable people are available for equipment maintenance. In the past nine years, more than 300,000 people have gained greater mobility through this program.</para>

					<title paraID="14">Vision Treatment</title>
					<para paraID="15">Some of the blindness in the world today can be treated, corrected, or halted with medical procedures. The Church’s vision treatment initiative works to improve vision care and prevent eye problems by providing equipment and training through short-term specialists. These specialists give local medical professionals the equipment, supplies, and training they need to care for their patients long after the specialists have left the country. In Mongolia, for example, local medical personnel who were trained through the vision treatment initiative are now performing free diabetic retinopathy screenings.</para>

					<title paraID="16">Neonatal Resuscitation</title>
					<para paraID="17">A baby’s first cry is music to the mother. But too often, in too many places, instead of a cry and the glad voice of a nurse or midwife, there is only silence due to a blocked airway. It’s tragic, because using an inexpensive bulb syringe and proven rescue breathing techniques, doctors, nurses, and midwives can often save struggling newborns who would otherwise die.</para>
					<para paraID="18">The Church’s neonatal resuscitation training (NRT) initiative uses short-term specialists to train local doctors, nurses, and midwives in NRT techniques. The program requires each person who participates to provide the training to other birth attendants in their area.</para>
					<para paraID="19">This train-the-trainer method allows lifesaving knowledge and supplies to quickly cross boundaries of language and culture. Medical communities are improved, birth attendants no longer watch helplessly when a newborn struggles to draw breath, and families are blessed. Liz Howell, an international health coordinator with LDS Charities, said, “It truly is a life-changing and a lifesaving program.”</para>

					<para paraID="21">Diseases that no longer threaten children in developed nations still rage in many countries. Measles is one of the leading causes of death of young children, according to the World Health Organization.<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker></para>
					<para paraID="22">Hunger and malnutrition are also prevalent, <pageBreak pageNum="76"/>stunting the physical and mental development of children and greatly increasing their susceptibility to diseases such as measles. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, “undernourishment and deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals cost more than five million children their lives every year.”<noteMarker noteRef="2">2</noteMarker></para>
					<para paraID="23">In 2003 the Church joined the international Measles Initiative and Partnership. In addition to financial contributions, the Church has played a significant role in organizing, promoting, and conducting local vaccination campaigns using Church volunteers. Since 2003, approximately 56,000 Church members have provided more than 600,000 hours of service in 32 nations. Since 2001, the Measles Initiative and Partnership has vaccinated 600 million children and youth. Measles deaths worldwide have decreased from 750,000 in 2000 to 197,000 in 2007.<noteMarker noteRef="3">3</noteMarker></para>
					<para paraID="24">The Church’s humanitarian efforts have always included helping to feed the hungry. But now chronic hunger and malnutrition are also being addressed by a food initiative that teaches communities in both rural and urban areas how to grow vegetables and to raise small animals for protein. Many of the techniques being taught are based on years of research by the Benson Institute, which became part of Latter-day Saint Charities in 2007.</para>

					<para paraID="27">When they see suffering and need in the world, followers of Christ instinctively desire to help. These humanitarian initiatives provide an organized and effective way for Church members to act on their desire to follow the Savior’s admonition: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do” (<scriptureRef book="3-ne" chapter="27" verse="21">3<nb/>Nephi 27:21</scriptureRef>).</para>

				<para paraID="4"><pageBreak pageNum="76"/>A century ago this month, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and organ were first recorded in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. To mark the anniversary, the choir has released a three-disc set, <emphasis>100: Celebrating a Century of Recording Excellence,</emphasis> including selections from its 100-year history of recorded music.</para>
				<para paraID="5">Today, many would agree with famed director Eugene Ormandy, who said, “The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is the greatest choir in the world.”<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker> But in the first few decades after it was formed in the mid-19th century, the Tabernacle Choir remained largely unknown because few people around the world had heard it perform. Then in 1909—32 years after the invention of the phonograph—the Columbia Phonograph Company agreed to <pageBreak pageNum="77"/>attempt to capture the majestic sounds of the choir and organ. It would be a difficult task given the limited technology of the time, which worked well enough for soloists but generally failed to produce quality recordings of large groups.<noteMarker noteRef="2">2</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="6">Over three days in late August and early September 1910, Alexander Hausmann, the recording engineer who supervised the operation, suspended two long recording horns “from a rope stretched across from gallery to gallery, the flaring bells of the two horns covering—the one the sopranos and altos, the other the tenors and basses.”<noteMarker noteRef="3">3</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="7">The <emphasis>Salt Lake Herald</emphasis> reported that Mr. Hausmann made 25 recordings: 12 selections by the choir, 10 by Tabernacle organist John<nb/>J. McClellan, 2 by Brother McClellan and violinist Willard<nb/>E. Weihe, and one by former Tabernacle organist Joseph<nb/>J. Daynes<nb/>Sr.<noteMarker noteRef="4">4</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="8">While it is not known how many finished discs were ultimately sold or how broadly they were distributed, the public response was positive. J.<nb/>A. Vernon, a missionary serving in Larned, Kansas, USA, reported in a letter printed in the February 1911 <emphasis>Improvement Era:</emphasis> “We recently received some phonograph records containing songs and solos by the Tabernacle Choir and organ. On hearing them played, the people become inquisitive, which gives us many opportunities to explain the principles of the gospel.”<noteMarker noteRef="5">5</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="9">Since those first rudimentary recording sessions in 1910, the Tabernacle Choir has released more than 175 albums, including two that have sold more than a million copies each. One of the choir’s recordings received a U.S. Grammy Award in 1959, and another album garnered two Grammy nominations in 2007. More important than awards and honors, however, is the effect of the choir’s music upon its listeners. Though technology has changed dramatically over the past century, the recorded music of the choir continues to move and inspire, just as it did in 1910.</para>

I have read the magazine and loved its messages since I was a child, and it is so valuable to me. Now I am a single adult, and it is amazing to me that Heavenly Father is interested in me in particular. My heartfelt thanks to you for this work of love.</para>

					<para paraID="6">Not long ago our family moved from Korea to the United States. Things were hectic as we settled in. Our first Monday, we held a simple family home evening. A set of scriptures was our only resource, so we read in 3<nb/>Nephi about Christ’s appearance to the Nephites. We felt that even though we were in a totally new situation, place, and country, the Lord was mindful of us, just as He was the Nephites.</para>
					<para paraID="7">As a family we knelt in a circle and prayed. Despite our exhaustion from the move, we felt a deep sense of comfort, knowing that we would always have one another and Heavenly Father and the Savior to rely on. We knew that everything would turn out for the best. And it has.</para>

			<kicker paraID="4">My daughter’s concern for one tiny lost fish made me think of someone for whom we are never lost and never insignificant.</kicker>
		</titleBlock>

			<para paraID="5"><pageBreak pageNum="80"/>A member of our bishopric knew that my nine-year-old daughter kept an aquarium and one day asked if she might want some more fish. His family was going on vacation and needed to empty their aquarium. The offer was immediately accepted, and to my daughter’s delight, a pregnant female guppy was among the group.</para>
			<para paraID="6">Upon coming home from church one afternoon, my daughter did her routine check on the aquarium to see if each fish was happy and healthy. To her surprise, she saw four tiny, newborn fish. The mother guppy had begun to deliver. Acting quickly, she moved the babies to the safety box that would protect them from the bigger and more aggressive fish. In all of the excitement, however, one baby guppy was lost. Crying with disappointment, my daughter located it lying among the tiny rocks on the bottom of the aquarium. She tried to scoop it into her net to be placed in the safety box, but she couldn’t move the tiny guppy without injuring it.</para>
			<para paraID="7">All the other tiny guppies were caught, and although the safety box teemed with dozens of new babies, my daughter’s attention was still intently focused on the one fallen among the stones. She sat ready to help it into the box as soon as it could move. She even refused dinner as she sat attentively by her aquarium for about four hours.</para>
			<para paraID="8">Watching her struck some familiar and tender chords. I thought of the Good Shepherd, who leaves His ninety and nine to look for the one who is lost (see <scriptureRef book="luke" chapter="15" verse="3-8">Luke 15:3–8</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="john" chapter="10" verse="11-14">John 10:11–14</scriptureRef>). All of us know how it feels to be lost or afflicted or spiritually sick. Yet our Savior never gives up on us. He is always there with outstretched arms, ready and willing to rescue us, strengthen us, and bless us.</para>
			<para paraID="9">Though we may not always realize it, our Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ, tenderly and closely watch over us night and day, deeply concerned about our well-being and the roads we choose to walk. With love unbounded, They give Their angels charge concerning us, waiting for us to gather enough strength and faith to find safety and peace in Their arms.</para>
			<para paraID="10">Later that day my daughter’s concern for that guppy paid off. After her long, tedious hours of waiting and hoping, the tiny fish finally wiggled and then slowly swam out of the rocks. Carefully she placed it in the comfort and security of the safety box. That was witness enough for me of the sustaining power of love.</para>
