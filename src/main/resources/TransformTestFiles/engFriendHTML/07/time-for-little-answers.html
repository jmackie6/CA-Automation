			<p data-aid="125694243" id="p2">Rachel loved her Sunbeam class. Her teacher, Sister Monson, had something special for them each Sunday to take home to help them remember what she had taught them. Once it was a picture of Jesus praying. Once it was a tiny mirror with “I am a child of God” printed around it. Last Sunday it had been a kitten puppet with a soft tummy for helping Mommy do the dusting. Rachel had named her dustcloth Ditty.</p>
			<p data-aid="125694244" id="p3">Every day when Mommy did the dusting, Rachel would get Ditty from the cleaning shelf and help. She liked to dust the rocking chair the best. It would gently rock to and fro as she dusted from the very top to the very bottom.</p>
			<p data-aid="125694245" id="p4">But today Ditty was lost. It wasn’t on the shelf when Mommy started dusting. Rachel had looked everywhere she could think of. But still no Ditty.</p>
			<p data-aid="125694246" id="p5">Mommy was just finishing the last shelf on the bookshelf when Rachel came into the living room and asked, “Mommy, does Heavenly Father have time for little answers?”</p>
			<p data-aid="125694247" id="p6">Mommy stopped her dusting and took Rachel’s hand. Together they walked to the couch, and Mommy lifted Rachel up onto her lap. “That sounds like a pretty serious question,” Mommy said. “Do you want to tell me what the problem is?”</p>
			<p data-aid="125694248" id="p7">“Ditty’s lost,” Rachel explained, “and I’ve looked everywhere. Sister Monson said that Heavenly Father has time to listen to big and little people about important things. I know that He helped when Daddy was looking for a job. And He helped Grandma when she fell and broke her hip. But does Heavenly Father have time to help me find Ditty?”</p>
			<p data-aid="125694249" id="p8">“Ditty is pretty important to you, isn’t it?” Rachel nodded sadly. Mommy stroked Rachel’s hair and wiped a tear from her cheek. “Well, anything that’s really important to you is important to Him, too,” Mommy assured her. “Would you like me to pray with you about Ditty?”</p>
			<p data-aid="125694250" id="p9">Rachel nodded, and they knelt together beside the couch.</p>
			<p data-aid="125694251" id="p10">“Do you want me to say it?” Mommy asked.</p>
			<p data-aid="125694252" id="p11">“No,” Rachel answered. “It’s my Ditty, so it should be my prayer.”</p>
			<p data-aid="125694253" id="p12">Mommy nodded and bowed her head. Rachel began.</p>
			<p data-aid="125694254" id="p13">“Heavenly Father, I thank Thee for Mommy and Daddy and all our nice things. Please help me to find Ditty. It’s important to me because Sister Monson gave it to me and because it helps me help Mommy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”</p>
			<p data-aid="125694255" id="p14">Rachel and Mommy stayed kneeling quietly for a few minutes. Then Rachel smiled and reached for Mommy’s hand. “I just remembered where Ditty is!” Rachel said. “I was using it when I hid behind the couch to surprise Daddy yesterday.” She jumped up and looked behind the couch. Sure enough, there was Ditty. Rachel got it and crawled out to Mommy’s waiting arms. “He really did have time for a little answer, didn’t He?”</p>
			<p data-aid="125694256" id="p15">“Yes, Rachel,” Mommy reassured her, “and He always will.”</p>
