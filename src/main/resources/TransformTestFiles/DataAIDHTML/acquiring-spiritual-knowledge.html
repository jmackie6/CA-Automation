					<p data-aid="135533108" id="p2">Invite a student to read aloud the following account given by Sister Sheri&#160;L. Dew, who served as Second Counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<img alt="Sheri L. Dew" class="headshot" id="img1" src="1477703"></img>
						<p data-aid="135533109" id="p3">“A marvelous young woman … called me, distraught. Through sobs she blurted, ‘I’m not sure I believe the Church is true anymore, and I’m scared. What if my family isn’t going to be together forever?’” (Sheri&#160;L. Dew, <a href="http://www.byui.edu/devotionals/sheri-dew">“Will You Engage in the Wrestle?”</a> [Brigham Young University–Idaho devotional, May&#160;17, 2016], <span class="language" lang="eng">byui.edu/devotionals</span>).</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p data-aid="135533110" id="p4">Invite students to consider if they or someone they know has experienced concerns and feelings similar to those experienced by the young woman Sister Dew spoke of.</p>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li>
							<p data-aid="135533111" id="p5">If this young woman came to you for help, what might you say or do to help her?</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p data-aid="135533112" id="p6">Invite a student to continue reading Sister Dew’s account aloud:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p data-aid="135533113" id="p7">“I asked, ‘Do you want a testimony?’ ‘Yes,’ she said.</p>
						<p data-aid="135533114" id="p8">“‘Are you willing to work for it?’ Again, ‘Yes’” (Sheri&#160;L. Dew, <a href="http://www.byui.edu/devotionals/sheri-dew">“Will You Engage in the Wrestle?” </a> <span class="language" lang="eng">byui.edu/devotionals</span>).</p>
					</blockquote>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li>
							<p data-aid="135533115" id="p9">Why do you think it might have been helpful to ask this young woman if she desired a testimony of the gospel and if she was willing to work for it?</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p data-aid="135533116" id="p10">Explain that during their experience in seminary, students will have many opportunities to work to increase their understanding and testimony of the gospel and to learn how to find answers to their questions and the questions others may have about the Church—including its teachings and history. One opportunity they have to do this is through Doctrinal Mastery. Doctrinal Mastery includes seeking to learn and apply principles of acquiring spiritual knowledge and developing a deeper understanding of key doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

							<img alt="Sheri L. Dew" class="headshot" id="figure2_img1" src="1477703"></img>
							<p data-aid="135533158" id="figure2_p1">“I told [the young woman], ‘Bring your scriptures and every question you have. Questions are good. Let’s see what the Lord will teach us.’</p>
							<p data-aid="135533159" id="figure2_p2">“She took me at my word and brought one thorny question after another. We searched the scriptures and the teachings of prophets for answers. Little by little, she began to realize that just because she had questions didn’t mean she didn’t have a testimony. The scriptures are filled with accounts of prophets who had questions. And she began to recognize when the Spirit was bearing witness to her—including bearing witness that prophets, seers, and revelators are truly prophets.</p>
							<p data-aid="135533160" id="figure2_p3">“Her testimony began to grow, and time passed. Then about a year ago she called again. ‘I wanted you to be one of the first to know that I am holding in my hand a temple recommend. Will you come when I receive my endowment?’ Then she added, ‘Do you know what you said that helped me the most? You told me that questions are good, and that allowed me to see myself as a seeker rather than a doubter.’</p>
							<p data-aid="135533161" id="figure2_p4">“I was overjoyed! But two days later, I received a much different call from another [young woman]. ‘Sister Dew,’ she said, ‘before you hear it from someone else, I want you to know that I’m pregnant.’ She said that for several years she had doubted the truthfulness of the gospel and had finally decided there was no reason to live the law of chastity.</p>
							<p data-aid="135533162" id="figure2_p5">“I told her that I was not her judge and that I loved her. Then I asked her if she would like to have a testimony. ‘No, I don’t think so,’ she said.</p>
							<p data-aid="135533163" id="figure2_p6">“The contrast was stunning. At about the same time, these two young women had questions that threatened their testimonies. One of them sent out a cry for help, and family, friends and leaders followed President Monson’s counsel and went to her rescue. The other girl nursed her doubt and convinced herself that her immoral choices were acceptable.&#160;…</p>
							<p data-aid="135533164" id="figure2_p7">“One girl’s questions propelled her to become a seeker of truth. The other girl used her questions to justify her immorality.</p>
							<p data-aid="135533165" id="figure2_p8">“My dear friends, questions are good. Questions are good if they are inspired questions, asked in faith, and asked of credible sources where the Spirit will direct and confirm the answer.&#160;…</p>
							<p data-aid="135533166" id="figure2_p9">“None of us are entitled to revelation without effort on our part. Answers from God don’t just magically appear. If we want to grow spiritually, the Lord expects us to ask questions and seek answers. ‘If thou shalt ask,’ He promised, ‘thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge’ [<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.html?verse=61#p61">D&amp;C 42:61</a>]. How much clearer can it be? The Lord loves inspired questions asked in faith because they lead to knowledge, to revelation, and to greater faith” (Sheri&#160;L.

						<p data-aid="135533197" id="p71">“Though I suffered then, I am grateful now that there was not a quick solution to my problem. The fact that I was forced to turn to God for help almost daily over an extended period of years taught me how to truly pray and get answers to prayer and taught me in a practical way to have faith in God. I came to know my Savior and my Heavenly Father in a way and to a degree that might not have happened otherwise or that might have taken me much longer. … I learned to trust in the Lord with all my heart. I learned to walk with Him day by day” (D.&#160;Todd Christofferson, <a class="legacy-cross-ref" data-legacy-href="../../liahona/2012/01/recognizing-gods-hand-in-our-daily-blessings.html?para=p14-p16#p14">“Recognizing God’s Hand in Our Daily Blessings”</a> <em> Ensign,</em> Jan. 2012, 18–19).</p>

This life is like the second act in a three-act play. Its purpose is defined by what is revealed about our spiritual existence in act&#160;1 and our eternal destiny in act&#160;3.

					<p data-aid="135533278" id="p121">Before class, write the references to the following doctrinal mastery passages on the board: <em> <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.html?verse=30#p30">2&#160;Nephi 28:30</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.html?verse=3#p3">2&#160;Nephi 32:3</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.html?verse=8-9#p8">2&#160;Nephi 32:8–9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.html?verse=9#p9">Mosiah 4:9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/bofm/ether/12.html?verse=6#p6">Ether 12:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/bofm/moro/10.html?verse=4-5#p4">Moroni 10:4–5</a>.</em></p>
					<p data-aid="135533280" id="p122">Divide students into pairs. Ask them to review the doctrine taught in the passages on the board by having one student in each pair use the <a class="legacy-cross-ref" data-legacy-file-id="13266_000_03" data-legacy-href="../../null" data-legacy-para-id="1"><em>Doctrinal Mastery Reference Guide</em></a> and, in a random order, read aloud the key phrase for each of those doctrinal mastery passages. When a key phrase is read, the other student states which passage on the board is associated with the key phrase. After a few minutes, have students switch roles with their partners.</p>
					<p data-aid="135533282" id="p123">Next, to help students become familiar with the scripture text of the doctrinal mastery passages, read a passage aloud without telling students the reference. Invite students to see if they can locate the passage and join you in reading it aloud before you have finished reading the passage. After the passage is read, invite one or more students to explain in their own words the doctrine or principle taught in the passage. Repeat this activity for each of the doctrinal mastery passages listed on the board.</p>
