			<p data-aid="127321315" id="p2">Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are among the healthiest and longest-living people on the earth today. Such are the blessings of obedience to the Word of Wisdom—a revelation found in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants—which provides guidelines for healthy living. Of all the treasures unveiled in the Word of Wisdom, perhaps the most precious gem is that “tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man.” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../../scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.html?verse=8#p8">D&amp;C 89:8</a>.)</p>
			<p data-aid="127321318" id="p3">This simple and profound truth was offered to the world more than a century ahead of the scientific literature that now supports it. Though many of the following statistics are from studies conducted in the United States, the results apply worldwide. For example, cigarette smoking is now recognized as the most common preventable cause of death, early loss of health, and disability in America. Tobacco is accountable for more than one out of every four deaths, and it causes more illness and death than all other drugs—including alcohol and all illegal substances. Appropriately, the surgeon general has given cigarette smoking the distinction “Public Health Enemy Number One.”</p>

				</header>
				<ul class="bullet">
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321322" id="p4">Surveys, in fact, indicate that 80 to 90 percent of smokers would like to quit smoking. At least seven out of ten smokers relapse, beginning to smoke again within three months after trying to quit. Hence, it appears that most smokers smoke not because they want to, but because they are unable to quit.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321323" id="p5">A teenage smoking survey conducted by the U.S. government found that youth who smoked thought they would “definitely not” or “probably not” be smoking in five years. This strongly suggests that most youth underestimate the difficulty of breaking the habit.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321324" id="p6">Addiction to the powerful drug nicotine is the primary reason for continued use of tobacco and is directly related to the difficulty users have in quitting. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known to man. The surgeon general has compared it to heroin and cocaine in its addictive power.</p>

				<ul class="bullet">
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321326" id="p7">Yes! About forty million Americans have overcome their addiction to cigarettes. However, most have tried many times to quit smoking before they were successful.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321327" id="p8">About half of all living adults who have ever smoked have quit.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321328" id="p9">In most cases, even after many years of addiction, quitting smoking brings health risk rates more in line with those of nonsmokers.</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321331" id="p11">Utah has the lowest prevalence of smoking, with smokers making up only 18 percent of the population, while Kentucky exhibits the highest prevalence, with smokers making up 38 percent of the population.</p>

					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321332" id="p12">Every day more than three thousand American teenagers start the smoking habit, with girls showing greater prevalence than boys since the middle of the 1970s.</p>

				</header>
				<ul class="bullet">
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321382" id="p45">It is a common misconception that dipping snuff and chewing tobacco are safe alternatives to cigarette smoking. Therefore, while cigarette smoking has declined during the past two decades, the use of smokeless tobacco has risen sharply.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321383" id="p46">Six million Americans use smokeless tobacco at least weekly. The highest usage rate is among teenage boys.</p>

					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321384" id="p47">Smokeless tobacco users have two-and-a-half times the rate of high cholesterol as nontobacco users.</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-aid="127321391" id="p50">Since nicotine passes through the mucous linings of the mouth into the bloodstream, blood nicotine levels are at least as high in users of smokeless tobacco as in those who smoke cigarettes. Therefore, many of the health hazards of using smokeless tobacco are similar to those of smoking.</p>

				</header>
				<p data-aid="127321405" id="p54">One of the primary purposes for our coming to earth was to receive a physical body. The human body is a priceless gift, the greatest creation of the Lord. Proper care of the body shows gratitude to the Lord for this gift and for the opportunity he has given us to progress.</p>
				<p data-aid="127321407" id="p55">Maintaining a healthy body allows us to participate fully in life and to experience the many joys afforded by work and play. Without the Lord’s simple warning concerning tobacco in 1833, thousands of modern-day Saints would have suffered the physical pain and spiritual distress that accompanies addiction to tobacco. As in days past and years to come, because faithful Saints have obeyed the counsel of the Lord and abstained from tobacco, countless lives have been blessed.</p>
