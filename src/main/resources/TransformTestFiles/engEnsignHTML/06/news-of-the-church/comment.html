			<p data-aid="127319766" id="p2">I am currently an inmate in a Washington state prison, so I read the article about the Church-sponsored programs in the Utah State Prison (March 1991) with great interest. I am writing to share with you the things that are provided to the “members” of the Church here at Clallam Bay Corrections Center.</p>
			<p data-aid="127319767" id="p3">Our support comes from the Forks Branch of the Silverdale Washington Stake. Though they are a small branch, the branch president has assigned four priesthood holders the responsibility of holding weekly meetings here in the prison. There are six to eight “members” in the group, plus one or two others who attend. In our meetings we learn more about the Church by studying the scriptures and the priesthood lessons.</p>
			<p data-aid="127319768" id="p4">From time to time the branch priesthood meets here in the prison so we can meet the brethren and they can meet us. In those meetings we are able to share our feelings through testimony bearing.</p>
			<p data-aid="127319769" id="p5">I am truly grateful to these good brethren who sacrifice their time so we can have this important contact with the Church. Without that, life would be much harder for me.</p>

			<p data-aid="127319771" id="p7"><strong><em>Friends Make the World Better</em></strong></p>
			<p data-aid="127319772" id="p8">I cannot tell you how delighted I was with “Do I Know My Neighbor?” in the March <em>Ensign.</em> I love the members of the Church, but I also love many who belong to various other churches. Roger R. Keller has given a fine explanation of the great value of all Christian churches in making the world a better place and helping to prepare others to receive the fulness of the gospel.</p>
			<p data-aid="127319773" id="p9">There is much we can learn from the dedication and contributions of those of other faiths. We only hurt our own image and purpose when we dismiss their feelings and efforts.</p>

			<p data-aid="127319775" id="p11"><strong><em>Hooray for Humanitarian Efforts</em></strong></p>
			<p data-aid="127319777" id="p12">Thanks for the article in the September 1990 <em>Ensign</em> regarding Church aid to Iranian earthquake victims. I believe that when we help others in times of need, we are doing what our Heavenly Father would want us to do. And by helping others, we sanctify ourselves.</p>
			<p data-aid="127319779" id="p13">I am thankful to be a member of the Church, and I am thankful that we can participate in humanitarian efforts when tragedies strike.</p>

			<p data-aid="127319783" id="p15"><strong><em>An Honest Look at Unemployment</em></strong></p>
			<p data-aid="127319785" id="p16">I enjoyed the article “Surviving Unemployment” in the February 1991 issue. Although we are not unemployed now, there have been times in our married life when we have been. Reading the article brought back memories, and I cried as I remembered our pain as well as our gratitude to Heavenly Father for helping us get through it.</p>
			<p data-aid="127319787" id="p17">The article is helpful because it deals honestly with the feelings of doubt and hopelessness, the ups and downs that one experiences during such an ordeal. Sister Young’s story will help those who are experiencing unemployment and help the rest of us to become prepared, as we have been counseled, in case such an event does arise.</p>
