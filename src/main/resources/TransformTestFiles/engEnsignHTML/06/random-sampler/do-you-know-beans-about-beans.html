			<p data-aid="127321248" id="p1">Dried beans are inexpensive and they keep well, so they are an excellent item to add to your food storage. They provide complete protein if you combine them with grains such as wheat, rice, or corn. The protein value of the meal increases when you serve beans and grains with other complete proteins such as meat, cheese, or eggs.</p>
			<p data-aid="127321250" id="p2">The problem with dried beans is that many people don’t use them; either they don’t know how to cook them or they don’t want to take the time. If you fall into one of those categories, here are instructions for both traditional and quick methods of preparing beans.</p>
			<p data-aid="127321252" id="p3"><em>Overnight soaking:</em> Beans soaked overnight retain their shape better, have a more uniform texture, and require less time to cook. This method is best if you are planning to use the beans in salads. Wash the beans; then soak each pound (two and one-half cups) of dried beans overnight in six cups (two and three-fourths imperial pints) of water. If you like, you can dissolve two teaspoons of salt in the water for flavor. After soaking the beans, drain and discard water. Rinse beans.</p>
			<p data-aid="127321253" id="p4"><em>Quick soaking:</em> For each pound of dried beans, bring eight cups (three and one-half imperial pints) of water to a boil. Add washed beans and cook for two minutes. Remove from heat. Cover pan and soak for one hour. Drain and rinse beans; discard water.</p>
			<p data-aid="127321254" id="p5"><em>To cook soaked beans:</em> For each pound of dried beans, dissolve two teaspoons of salt in six cups (two and three-fourths imperial pints) of boiling water. Add drained, soaked beans and simmer them in an uncovered pan until tender; time for this process varies from twenty-five minutes to two hours. If necessary, add more water as beans simmer, keeping the liquid level with the beans. Drain. Each pound of dried beans makes six to seven cups (about three imperial pints) of cooked beans.</p>
			<p data-aid="127321255" id="p6"><em>To cook beans without presoaking:</em> Be sure to plan for extra cooking time if you use this method. For each cup (eight ounces) of dried beans, bring three cups (one and one-fourth imperial pints) of water and one-half teaspoon of salt to a boil. Add beans. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, adding water as needed to keep beans covered.<strong>—Relief Society General Board</strong></p>
