		<bodyBlock>
			<para paraID="5">My dear brothers and sisters, we are sure all of you have been thrilled with the announcement of the construction of several new temples. There now begins the most intensive period of temple building in the history of the Church. We look to the day when the sacred ordinances of the Church, performed in the temples, will be available to all members of the Church in convenient locations around the globe.</para>
			<para paraID="6">The building of these temples must be accompanied by a strong emphasis on genealogical research on the part of members of the Church.</para>
			<para paraID="7">We feel an urgency for this great work to be accomplished and wish to encourage the Saints to accept their responsibility of performing temple ordinances, writing their personal and family history, participating in the name extraction program when called to do so, completing their four-generation research, and then continuing their family research to ensure the redemption of their kindred dead.</para>
			<para paraID="8">This individual effort will move us forward in the great responsibility resting upon us for the redemption of those who have died without a knowledge of the truth.</para>
			<para paraID="9">Equally thrilling to me is the fact that we have just passed the thirty thousand mark for full-time missionaries. We have been advised by the Missionary Committee that as of March 25, we had 30,004 full-time missionaries. You may remember that, when we spoke to you at the April 1974 seminar for Regional Representatives, we had a total of 18,600 missionaries. This is a remarkable increase, and we are grateful for it. Seventy-nine percent of the new totals are young men; 13 percent are young women; and 8 percent represents older couples. But with all of this, we have not yet reached our potential! With our responsibility to share the gospel with the entire world, we continue to need more missionaries—many, many more.</para>
			<para paraID="10">As we have done before, we wish to caution you as Regional Representatives, and through you our local leaders and members, about involvement in political and governmental matters—especially in the United States in this election year. Many times we have urged Church members to be “anxiously engaged” in good causes and to perform their duties as citizens responsibly. We reiterate, however, that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints cannot be committed, as an institution, except on those issues which are determined by the First Presidency and Twelve to be of such a nature that the Church should take an official position concerning them. The proposed Equal Rights Amendment is such an issue. We believe that to proceed otherwise would divert the Church from its basic mission of teaching the restored gospel to the world.</para>
			<para paraID="11">Those who have been careful and thoughtful students of what has happened in the last several years will have noticed a number of developments which form a clear pattern. A year ago, for instance, we placed a stronger emphasis upon councils, ranging from the family council on through to region and area councils, and the Church coordinating council, as a means of emphasizing the ecclesiastical or priesthood line by which direction and communications are to flow. We hope that these councils are carefully planned and conducted so that they respond to the needs of our people, within Church policy.</para>
			<para paraID="12">You have seen an emphasis on simplification of Church programs so that these programs can move wherever the gospel goes in the world without too much difficulty and without too much complexity.</para>
			<para paraID="13">We have seen further emphasis on enriching family life. Recently we established the new consolidated schedule which is aimed at enriching family life even further, together with greater opportunity for individual and family gospel scholarship and for more Christian service. We are trying to provide more time and emphasis on Christian service, so that our example can be more powerful in the world and so that those who are so worthy of attention might get more attention than they sometimes have in the past.</para>
			<para paraID="14">We now have a wonderful new edition of the King James Version of the Holy Bible with a topical index and a whole new reference system. Soon we hope to have our other holy scriptures in this same format, all of which should encourage further involvement with the scriptures, as individuals and as families.</para>
			<para paraID="15">We hope all of you see the pattern that is unfolding and the underlying purposes which will combine to help us grow spiritually. We hope you will help the Church to achieve major growth, both through more effective missionary work and through reaching out in a program of reactivation. If we can reach out to our nonmember friends and reach out in programs of reactivation while enriching family life and being better neighbors, there is so much that can move us forward as a people—all in fulfillment of those prophecies about the growth and development of the Church in our time.</para>
			<para paraID="16">Please keep the spirit and purpose of these program adjustments before you. It would be a mistake simply to rush in to fill up the time with more meetings. It would be a mistake for families simply to pursue worldly activities on the Sabbath. It would be a mistake for us as a people to try to do so many different things at once that nothing gets done really well.</para>
			<para paraID="17">Further, if you will follow the pattern which is unfolding, you will be blessed even more richly by our Heavenly Father and his guiding Spirit. Whether members of the Church live in the Philippines or in Philadelphia, in Australia or Argentina, they will be blessed to make correct decisions and to put their lives more fully in order. Much has been accomplished that is wonderful and good. But the Lord expects us to do even better than we have done. These improvements in the programs and this making of some adjustments should combine to strengthen us to meet the challenges which surely lie ahead.</para>
			<para paraID="18">Live in your own houses in a manner that will permit you to go to the Lord’s house feeling fully worthy and entitled to be there. Be examples in your own families of marital fidelity and accord so that there is love in your homes. Build up and enrich your home life so that so far as <emphasis>your </emphasis>home is concerned, “When the rains descend and the floods come and the winds blow and beat upon the house,” your home, it will stand (<scriptureRef book="matt" chapter="7" verse="24-27">Matt. 7:24–27</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="19">Live in such a way that if the enemies of the Church choose to speak critically of you, they must do so falsely. Never be a cause of any embarrassment to the Church.</para>
			<para paraID="20">God bless you always, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</para>

			<para paraID="6">“What manner of men ought ye to be?” the Savior asked of his Nephite Twelve as they were about to take over the ministry.</para>
			<para paraID="7">And what was the answer to that question? “Verily I say unto you, even as I am” (<scriptureRef book="3-ne" chapter="27" verse="27">3 Ne. 27:27</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="8">Even as he is! Think of it! Jesus the Christ is our pattern.</para>
			<para paraID="9">And when did he expect those brethren to adopt his pattern of life? It was not for any tomorrow or any future year. It was immediate. As his ministers, they had the responsibility then and there to reflect his image to all mankind.</para>
			<para paraID="10">That is the key to the manner in which all of us are to conduct his work.</para>
			<para paraID="11">But let us ask, what is his work? He says that his work and even his glory are to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. But what is eternal life? It is to become like God. Because we are his children, we have the potential of actually becoming perfect, as he is.</para>
			<para paraID="12">This opportunity is open to all mankind, in every land and clime. But it must come through faith in Christ. And how do people obtain that faith? Paul asked that same question in these words: “How … shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</para>
			<para paraID="13">“And how shall they preach, except they be sent?” (<scriptureRef book="rom" chapter="10" verse="14-15">Rom. 10:14–15</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="14">We are his preachers. We have been duly sent. Then how do we conduct our ministry?</para>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="15">Be Converted</title>
				<para paraID="16">Nicodemus came to Jesus at night. Can we ever forget what the Lord said to him? “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="3" verse="3">John 3:3</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="17">We relate this teaching to our being born of water and of the Spirit in baptism. Too often we rest with an explanation of water baptism alone and give little thought to the baptism of the Spirit.</para>
				<para paraID="18">We receive confirmation by the laying on of hands and are given the gift of the Holy Ghost. But we must remember that in that ordinance we also receive a newness of life. If we are sincere, we are literally born again. In a very real sense we become different and better persons. We receive a new heart. We put away the man of sin, as Paul describes it, and take upon ourselves the name and the image of Christ (see <scriptureRef book="col" chapter="3" verse="9-10">Col. 3:9–10</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="19">We need that rebirth so that others may believe through us that indeed Jesus was sent from heaven by his Father, that he is the Savior, and that we are his servants, authorized to lead them in the way of truth. That is the beginning of their salvation and an extension of ours.</para>
				<para paraID="20">We must constantly preserve the effect of his rebirth in our own lives. We seek rebirth for others through our ministry, but we cannot give something we ourselves do not possess. If our house is not properly structured, we can hardly be effective architects and builders in the lives of others.</para>
				<para paraID="21">So what manner of men must we be? Even as he is.</para>
				<para paraID="22">The Lord taught many important things which he expects of his disciples. One of his most penetrating lessons was that we should be living witnesses that he is the Christ, thus convincing other people that his Father in Heaven truly sent him into the world to become our Savior.</para>
				<para paraID="23">And as he prayed for his disciples, he also prayed “for them also which shall believe on me through their word.<nb/>…</para>
				<para paraID="24"><emphasis>“That the world may believe that thou hast sent me”</emphasis> (<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="17" verse="20-21">John 17:20–21</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="25">This is one of the most precise definitions of our divine calls that we have on record. What a purpose! What a responsibility! Those words should be our guiding star. But do we fully understand them?</para>
				<para paraID="26">They are the heart and core of our religion. No one can be saved without this basic faith. As officers of the Church, all we say and do must reflect this great truth. He is the Son of God. He is divine. He was sent into the world by the decree of heaven. We are his representatives, his witnesses, and he depends upon us to so labor that the world will believe that God did send him, and then perchance that many may live his gospel and be saved.</para>

				<title paraID="44">Be United</title>
				<para paraID="45">One of the most striking characteristics of the Lord Jesus Christ during his mortal ministry was his oneness with God. He desired earnestly that his disciples also should come into that circle of unity. It was essential to their mission. Prior to his passion he prayed that his disciples might be one, even as he and his Father were one (see <scriptureRef book="john" chapter="17" verse="20-21">John 17:20–21</scriptureRef>). And through Joseph Smith he said, “If ye are not one ye are not mine” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="38" verse="27">D&amp;C 38:27</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="46">This became a basic standard for his disciples everywhere. It is the foundation of all our successes. Without it, we surrender to the opposition.</para>
				<para paraID="47">Christ is the Prince of Peace. We also must be messengers of peace. Conflict can destroy us if we allow it to arise. It could seriously hurt the Church. It destroyed the ancient Church, and it could wipe us out. Do we recall what the Lord said about contention?</para>
				<para paraID="48">“There shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been.<nb/>…</para>
				<para paraID="49">“Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away” (<scriptureRef book="3-ne" chapter="11" verse="28,30">3 Ne. 11:28, 30</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="50">Do we remember what prevented the establishment of the city of Zion in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith? Joseph had sought the Lord in anxious prayer because of the expulsion of our people from Jackson County. In reply the Lord said about the Saints:</para>
				<para paraID="51">“Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances.</para>
				<para paraID="52">“They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble.</para>

				<title paraID="54">Be Obedient</title>
				<para paraID="55">The Lord gave an important parable through the Prophet Joseph urging the Saints to greater devotion, again showing how he expects us to follow his divine instructions. He said:</para>
				<para paraID="56">“A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very choice; and he said unto his servants: Go ye unto my vineyard, even upon this very choice piece of land, and plant twelve olive-trees;</para>
				<para paraID="57">“And set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive-trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take unto themselves the fruit of my vineyard.</para>
				<para paraID="58">“Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did as their lord commanded them, and planted the olive-trees, and built a hedge round about, and set watchmen, and began to build a tower.</para>
				<para paraID="59">“And while they were yet laying the foundation thereof, they began to say among themselves: And what need hath my lord of this tower?</para>
				<para paraID="60">“And consulted for a long time, saying among themselves: What need hath my lord of this tower, seeing this is a time of peace?</para>
				<para paraID="61">“Might not this money be given to the exchangers? For there is no need of these things.</para>
				<para paraID="62">“And while they were at variance one with another they became very slothful, and they hearkened not unto the commandments of their lord.</para>
				<para paraID="63">“And the enemy came by night, and broke down the hedge; and the servants of the nobleman arose and were affrighted, and fled; and the enemy destroyed their works, and broke down the olive-trees.</para>
				<para paraID="64">“Now, behold, the nobleman, the lord of the vineyard, called upon his servants, and said unto them, Why! what is the cause of this great evil?</para>
				<para paraID="65">“Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and—after ye had planted the vineyard, and built the hedge around about, and set watchmen upon the walls thereof—built the tower also, and set a watchman upon the tower, and watched for my vineyard, and not have fallen asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="101" verse="44-53">D&amp;C 101:44–53</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="66">Note the doubts that were raised by the servants in the vineyard. What need hath my Lord of this tower? What need? What need?</para>

				<title paraID="79">Be Producers</title>
				<para paraID="80">And next, the Lord expects us to be producers. He commands us to bring forth much fruit. This he illustrates with the parable found in the fifteenth chapter of John. There the Lord tells his servants how to conduct the work. There he establishes the image of a true servant of God.</para>
				<para paraID="81">This chapter begins with a parable concerning the vineyard of the Lord. He says that his Father is the husbandman, or the proprietor, and he likens himself to the vine in the vineyard. He says that we—his workers—are as branches on the vine, and that we are to bring forth much fruit in the vineyard of the Lord:</para>
				<para paraID="82">“I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</para>
				<para paraID="83">“Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.” [<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="15" verse="1-2">John 15:1–2</scriptureRef>]</para>
				<para paraID="84">Then he draws a picture which should be familiar to all of us. He speaks of pruning the vine to make it produce more. In his vineyard he prunes us—he purges us—he sanctifies us so that we will produce more of his kind of fruit.</para>
				<para paraID="85">He speaks next of branches that do not produce at all because they have become separated from the main part of the vine. And why do they not produce under those circumstances? Because the nourishing sap, the life-giving fluid, is cut off if the branch is severed from the vine. This fact persuaded the Lord to say to his servants: “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.” [<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="15" verse="4">John 15:4</scriptureRef>]</para>
				<para paraID="86">And then he adds: “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” [<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="15" verse="5">John 15:5</scriptureRef>]</para>
				<para paraID="87">Here is a great lesson. As long as we are close to the Lord and are nourished by his Spirit, we bring forth much fruit. But except we <emphasis>do </emphasis>abide in the Lord and receive of his strength, we can no more produce than can a branch that is severed from the tree. Hence he says: “Without me ye can do nothing.” [<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="15" verse="5">John 15:5</scriptureRef>]</para>
				<para paraID="88">To add further importance to this theme, the Lord says: “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.” [<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="15" verse="8">John 15:8</scriptureRef>]</para>
				<para paraID="89">But there is yet another lesson in this scripture which should give us great concern. In verse 16 he says:</para>
				<para paraID="90">“Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you.” To what purpose? “That ye should go and bring forth fruit.” [<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="15" verse="16">John 15:16</scriptureRef>]</para>
				<para paraID="91">But there is more. Not only are we chosen by him, not only are we ordained for the purpose of bringing forth fruit, but we are also called and ordained to so labor that our <emphasis>fruit will remain.</emphasis></para>
				<para paraID="92">Note his words: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, <emphasis>and that your fruit should remain.”</emphasis> [<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="15" verse="16">John 15:16</scriptureRef>]</para>
				<para paraID="93">What does that mean? Simply that we must plan and pray and work toward the end that there will be no dropouts because of our neglect, no one losing his testimony, no one going into inactivity. <emphasis>Our fruit must remain.</emphasis></para>
				<para paraID="94">Then the image of any servant of God comes back to a matter of <emphasis>attitude. </emphasis>As a man thinketh in his heart so will he labor.</para>
				<para paraID="95">This Church is the kingdom of God. The world is his field, or his vineyard. We are his chosen laborers. Success can be ours only if we abide closely in the Vine. And if we do, he gives us a golden promise which is most desirable:</para>
				<para paraID="96">“If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you, …</para>
				<para paraID="97">“If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.</para>
				<para paraID="98">“These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full” (<scriptureRef book="john" chapter="15" verse="7-11">John 15:7–11</scriptureRef>).</para>

			<para paraID="4">I was twelve years old when my grandfather died. To me he was the epitome of a saint—kindly, gentle, purely good. Though I lived in California and he in Utah, distance did not dim my adulation. Love can wing the friendly skies just as adeptly as the airlines.</para>
			<para paraID="5">His death hit me with disbelief, as well as grief. I had not only lost a friend but was convinced that somehow the eternal timing of his departure was incredibly off. In my youthful (though enthusiastic) grasp of the gospel, I had been sure that he was destined to be a great leader in the Church before he left this world. He was a man of great charity, was he not, who had literally given his shoes to a beggar knocking at the door, his coat to another colder than he? His leaving had to be premature, I reasoned.</para>
			<para paraID="6">He had too much more to give.</para>
			<para paraID="7">As I look back now with the eyes of one who has grown not only in inches but in understanding, I see that I equated ability with visibility. So many of the Saints have a basic goodness, a charity that qualifies them for discipleship. But serving is not synonymous with position. Whether serving in a visible example of goodness or in quiet corners, disciples follow the example of the Christ. A calling may help formalize our work for him, but serving is a blessing available to all of us, whether officially through the Church organization or in our daily association with others.</para>
			<para paraID="8">The way to become great by the Lord’s measuring stick is simply to serve. Chauncey Riddle, dean of Brigham Young University Graduate School, has dealt with the issue of the least and the greatest thusly: “Whereas people of the world concern themselves with those who have more wealth, talent, prestige, or athletic ability, true servants of Christ care about those who have less. … For the lesser to help the greater is not really help but servitude. … The person who has the superiority must place himself in a position of inferiority; he must become the servant of the one being helped” (“A B.Y.U. for Zion,” <emphasis>Speeches at the 100th Summer Commencement Exercises, </emphasis>Brigham Young University, 15 Aug. 1975, p. 4).</para>
			<para paraID="9">How do we become the servant of others? Through genuinely caring about them, through praying for the pure love of Christ to motivate us to serve (see <scriptureRef book="moro" chapter="7" verse="47-48">Moro. 7:47–48</scriptureRef>), and by taking the initiative to bless the lives of others. That constant of discipleship will wrap our own lives and the lives of those we meet in the soft, warm mantle of Christ’s love.</para>
			<para paraID="10">As an echo of the Savior’s life, my grandfather’s example was not lost. I was deeply affected by it, as I’m sure were countless others whose lives he touched. I will tell my own children about the patterns of goodness that emerged in his life in simple yet powerful ways. To tap that heritage of goodness to which he was heir—as all of us are—is to find our way to discipleship.</para>

			<para paraID="5">A few years ago, a lovely eighteen-year-old girl came to me, her stake president, for counseling. She was distraught and angry—her parents had insisted that she not see her boyfriend anymore. She said her father was a religious fanatic. Things were so bad she couldn’t stand to be in the same room with him.</para>
			<para paraID="6">I knew her father fairly well and was somewhat astonished as she continued to demean him. But I let her get her anger out, and then asked her to tell me about herself.</para>
			<para paraID="7">She told me how wonderful her parents had been until about six months before. Then, for some reason, things had changed. As she continued to talk, she confessed that her relationship with her boyfriend had gotten out of control, and both felt deeply guilty. Their guilt caused them to feel lonely when they were apart and they therefore began to see more and more of each other. Her parents resisted their spending so much time together.</para>
			<para paraID="8">Selfishness had led to sin, and contention was one of the fruits. With it came unhappiness and misery.</para>
			<para paraID="9">This experience illustrates an important principle about contention: Contention is <emphasis>often </emphasis>the result of selfishness. The person with a contentious spirit is usually thinking primarily of himself. And when we give in to such a spirit we separate ourselves further from the Spirit of God. “He that hath the spirit of contention is not of me,” said the Lord, “but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another (<scriptureRef book="3-ne" chapter="11" verse="29">3 Ne. 11:29</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="10">How does the devil use contention as a tool to draw us away from the Lord? He knows that contention feeds the selfish feelings that surface, enlarging them—thus creating distance between our real selves and our ideal selves, between our actions and our beliefs. That gap makes us feel guilty, as happened to the young lady who had come to me. More contention is often the result of the guilt. Thus, contention can both result from and perpetuate selfishness. Its effect is to block out the divine powers within each of us.</para>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="11">Contention between Husband and Wife</title>
				<para paraID="12">A prime field for Satan’s attack is marriage: he seeks to foster selfishness—and thus contention—between husbands and wives. Many experts declare that finances and incompatibility are the most common causes of marital disharmony. But in fact those two problems are only symptoms, not the real cause of marital illness. What, then, is that cause? Counseling hundreds of people over the past twenty-five years has convinced me it is selfishness. Most want to relieve their marriage difficulties by forcing their partner to change rather than changing themselves. The result is contention.</para>
				<para paraID="13">I was once visited by a young couple who obviously resented each other. As they began explaining their problems, they soon were in hot disagreement. Realizing they could not discuss their problems together, I excused the husband and asked the wife to explain things from her point of view. For the next forty-five minutes she painted an ugly picture of her husband. If I hadn’t seen him just a few minutes before, I would have concluded that she had married the devil himself!</para>
				<para paraID="14">Next I excused her and asked the husband to explain the problems as he perceived them. For forty-five minutes he angrily described the woman to whom he was married. Had I not talked to her just a few minutes before, I would have expected that she traveled around on a broom!</para>
				<para paraID="15">I then asked the two of them to come together into my office. I wrote out a prescription for them, which I felt would help them resolve their serious marital conflict. The prescription was quite simple—during the next week they were to write down twenty-five things they loved about their companions. If they would do this, I would see them the following Tuesday. The next Monday the husband called and informed me he could not come up with twenty-five items. He also stated that his wife was not doing much better. I told them I would give them one more week. If they had not completed the assignment by that time, I would not feel it beneficial to meet with them again.</para>
				<para paraID="16">When they arrived at the appointment a week later, I noticed a definite change in their demeanor. I could feel a warmth between them that had been absent two weeks before. As they sat down, I asked the husband to read the first item he had recorded. He began to read, but then his voice faltered—there was obviously a lump in his throat. I next asked his wife to read her first item. Her voice trembling, she read her first item. I noticed that a tear dropped from her eye and splashed on her paper. We got through only five of those items that night. They returned the following Tuesday for our concluding counseling session. As they left my office they had their arms around each other.</para>
				<para paraID="17">When two people join their lives together, there are bound to be little differences in tastes and preferences. If we will let him, Lucifer will magnify these little differences into major issues. The result is contention and resentment towards one another.</para>
				<para paraID="18">On the other hand, if we will look beyond these little differences, we will observe the great virtues in our companions and the Lord will magnify them for us. Looking at virtues will many times eliminate contention before it has a chance to grow and develop. Just as a farmer’s field will not produce a healthy crop when he fails to care for and nurture it, so a marriage will not grow in love, harmony, and happiness when the couple neglect caring for and nurturing their love. With such nurturing, there is no ground for contention to grow in.</para>
				<para paraID="19">One important part of nurturing is prayer as a couple. My wife and I decided when we got married that we would always kneel together at least twice a day. Hand in hand, we would thank our Heavenly Father for each other, night and morning, after which we would express our affection for each other with a kiss. We learned it is difficult to be angry with each other after thanking our Heavenly Father for our marriage.</para>
				<para paraID="20">Another part of nurturing a marriage is to keep fun in the romance. Little notes of appreciation, loving and thoughtful surprises played upon each other, a cake with “We Love You the Mostest, Daddy,” written on the top, can lighten a difficult day. A bouquet of flowers delivered to your sweetheart can bring joy to both husband and wife. A weekly date—even an inexpensive one—can help both partners know the other cares.</para>
				<para paraID="21">As we seek to let our love grow and keep contention out of our marriage, we must nurture our relationship by sharing ourselves with each other. If a husband or wife doesn’t take the time to listen to his or her companion’s concerns, a wall will be erected between the two. Contention will grow, and unhappiness and sometimes infidelity result. If we are still courting each other and working on our marriage, we will find a great joy and satisfaction in sharing our deep and intimate thoughts with each other.</para>
				<para paraID="22">Sometimes destructive contention comes into our marriage when we fail to live eternal truths. I recall one young couple from a neighboring community who entered my office and exclaimed, “President, you are our last chance.” I assured them I would help them in any way possible, but only they could save their faltering marriage. As we visited, they shared their past. She had waited for him while he served a mission. They had married, feeling sure their marriage was the ideal marriage. But in their desire for material wealth the husband began working on Sundays. Pretty soon he wasn’t paying his tithes and offerings. Gradually the husband grew so busy that he didn’t have time to spend with his wife, and he neglected their children as well. As frustrations increased, so did contention in their home. Eventually the wife turned elsewhere for love, which led to serious sin.</para>
				<para paraID="23">Now, with their family almost raised they wanted to save their marriage if they could. I asked them if I could be absolutely honest with them. They assured me that they had hoped I would. I pointed out that they desired eternal blessings but were neglecting to live eternal laws.</para>
				<para paraID="24">I then suggested to the husband that he needed to repent, that he needed to return to activity in the Church, that he needed to start paying his tithes and offerings, attending meetings, and living all the commandments. He needed to get his priorities in order.</para>
				<para paraID="25">I explained that the wife also needed to repent, go to her bishop and confess her sins, and rid herself of her guilt feelings. She, too, needed to return to her activities in the Church, live the commandments, and make their home a castle fit for a king, a place where her husband would look forward to coming each night, rather than staying at work a few more hours.</para>
				<para paraID="26">I promised them that if they would do this, their marriage could be saved. Those exciting and happy feelings which they once had enjoyed could indeed be rekindled. They struggled with the decision but finally committed to do everything they possibly could. I assured them it was going to be difficult. The wife might be excommunicated or disfellowshipped from the Church. The husband would have to change his whole life-style after twenty-five years of neglect. But the effort was essential for happiness.</para>
				<para paraID="27">It would have been easy to counsel this couple in little manipulative procedures, but their problems stemmed from breaking eternal laws, and it could not be corrected until these laws were lived. And though it took time and courage, this couple has now discovered the joy of living righteously. Many times, the only thing we need to do to remove contention from our homes is to repent.</para>

				<title paraID="28">Contention between Parents and Children</title>
				<para paraID="29">Satan also tries to bring contention into the relationship between parents and children. The first family on the earth had a serious problem with contention. Developing a rebellious and contentious spirit, Cain rose up in the field and slew his brother Abel (see <scriptureRef book="gen" chapter="4" verse="1-8">Gen. 4:1–8</scriptureRef>). From that day to this, Lucifer has successfully brought tremendous sorrow into families through contention. We are now living in a day when we have been taught by the philosophies of man that it is natural and normal for children to quarrel and fuss with each other, that this is even part of the maturation process. Although this may be natural, we should remember that the natural man is an enemy to God and that the Lord expects his children to be different (<scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="3" verse="19">Mosiah 3:19</scriptureRef>). As it says in <scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="4" verse="14">Mosiah 4:14</scriptureRef>, we should not permit quarreling in our families. We should teach that these things are not acceptable to our Heavenly Father. Contentious feelings in the home are often caused because we have not learned to listen effectively to our children. Through impatience, our discipline in the home becomes unfair, inconsistent, permissive, or too severe. The result is bad feelings in our children.</para>
				<para paraID="30">The greatest directive for family discipline that I know of is contained in Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–46 [<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="121" verse="41-46">D&amp;C 121:41–46</scriptureRef>]. Here the Lord admonishes us to discipline through persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, unfeigned love, kindness, and pure knowledge. If we will accept this marvelous revelation and implement it as our own law of discipline, we will remove a great deal of contention from our homes.</para>
				<para paraID="31">Some years ago the Melchizedek Priesthood Study Guide contained an excellent example of a father who tried to implement the principle of unfeigned love in his relationship with his son. The result was a removal of the contentious spirit between them. As the son tells us:</para>
				<para paraID="32">“Throughout my life as I grew up as a boy, my father and I had many serious arguments. One day, when I was seventeen, we had a particularly violent one. I said to him, ‘This is the straw that breaks the camel’s back. I’m leaving, and I will never return.’ So saying, I went to the house and packed a bag. My mother begged me to stay, but I was too mad and upset to listen. I left her crying at the doorway.</para>
				<para paraID="33">“As I left the yard and was about to pass through the gate, I heard my father call to me.</para>
				<para paraID="34">“‘Frank,’ he said, ‘I know that a large share of the blame for your leaving rests with me. For this I am deeply sorry. But I want you to know that if you should ever wish to return to our home, you’ll always be welcome. And I’ll try to be a better father to you. Finally, I want you to know that I’ll always love you.’</para>
				<para paraID="35">“I said nothing, but went to the bus station and bought a ticket to a hundred miles from nowhere. But as I sat in the bus watching the miles go by I began to think about the words of my father. I began to realize how much maturity, how much goodness, how much love it had required for him to do what he had done. He had apologized. He had invited me back and he left the words ringing in my ears: ‘I love you.’</para>
				<para paraID="36">“It was then that I realized that the next move was up to me. I knew that the only way I could ever find peace with myself was to demonstrate to him the same kind of maturity, goodness and love that he had demonstrated toward me.</para>
				<para paraID="37">“I got off the bus. I bought a return ticket to my home and went back. I arrived just shortly before midnight. I entered the house and turned on the light. There in our rocking chair sat my father, his head in his hands. As he looked up and saw me, he rose from the chair and we rushed into each other’s arms.</para>
				<para paraID="38">“That was the beginning of a new relationship between my father and me. Those last years that I was home were among the happiest of my life. I shall be forever grateful to him that in a moment of crisis he was able to put first things first” (Melchizedek Priesthood Study Guide, 1973–74, pp. 139–40).</para>

				<title paraID="39">Contention in the Church</title>
				<para paraID="40">Satan also seeks to sow contention in the Church setting. Sometimes contentions arise because we disagree with what a leader is trying to do.</para>
				<para paraID="41">I recall one couple who were very upset at their bishop. They came into my office and said the bishop had asked their son to be his assistant—but that the bishop had asked him to get his hair cut before he was presented to the quorum. Their son had come home angry. He had just had a haircut a few days before and felt no need to have it shorter. As the mother and father complained to me, they referred to how much more serious it would be if he were smoking or drinking. But getting a haircut seemed so trivial! Why would the bishop insist on that?</para>
				<para paraID="42">After listening to what they had to say, I asked them if they felt they really loved their son. They looked surprised at my question, but quickly assured me this was the reason they were here. I then told them that if he were my son I would go home and tell him how grateful I was that the bishop had such great love and respect for him. It was a great compliment to be chosen to be an assistant. Undoubtedly the bishop felt he must have leadership ability and the ability to be an example to all the other priests in the ward. I would explain to him how the Lord loves an obedient servant and that many times our obedience has to rest upon faith.</para>
				<para paraID="43">I told this wonderful couple that they needed to strengthen that bishop in the eyes of their son in every way possible; to do otherwise would only bring them unhappiness. Failure to support the bishop would communicate to their son that the bishop was not called of God, that we may follow our leaders only when we choose. The danger of this approach would be that they would be teaching their son that he was a law unto himself, ever sitting as a judge over the words and actions of those called to guide him. There would come a day, I said, when something much more critical than a haircut would arise to test their son. How he—and they—responded to this smaller test would help determine his response to the greater ones.</para>
				<para paraID="44">As we chatted, the contention in the room melted away. Through the Spirit we were all reminded that contention is of the devil and can bring only destructive results.</para>
				<para paraID="45">Sometimes we create contention in the Church by being insensitive to other people’s feelings. While serving as a missionary I was called to work in the mission home. Each morning it was my duty to teach a class in theology to all the missionaries there. One morning an elderly sister, just arrived in the mission, joined us for the class. During the discussion she took issue with a concept I was teaching and even wanted to argue her point. I was able to quickly put her down and prove her wrong. Then the Spirit of the Lord touched my soul and I noticed the hurt expression on her face. A question rushed through my mind: “What right did I have to be a missionary when I was so insensitive and unthoughtful to one of my sisters?”</para>
				<para paraID="46">At the end of the class I hurried to the mission library. For 1 1/2 hours I searched to find something to agree with what this sister had said. Finally I found a statement that supported her view. Delighted with my find, I now faced the challenge of my life. I had embarrassed her in front of all the missionaries; I now needed to repent in front of all the missionaries.</para>
				<para paraID="47">As we knelt at the breakfast table I asked President Bunker if I could take a few minutes before prayer was offered. I then turned to this dear sister, apologized for what I had done, and read the statement by Elder Whitney. With a slight smile she thanked me. Then an overwhelming feeling of love came into my bosom. I had just learned a great lesson: if we let pride stop us from doing what is right, we can miss some of life’s greatest joys.</para>
				<para paraID="48">That morning the prayer seemed to be more pure. Life was exciting, and I was extremely happy. After breakfast this sister came to me and thanked me again. Repentance had followed contention, and peace of mind was the result.</para>
				<para paraID="49">When we learn to overcome contention in our lives we bring ourselves closer to Christ. Feeding on selfishness corrodes our self-image and the peace and unity between husband and wife. It destroys relationships between family members, and thwarts the smooth progress of the Church. But as we learn the gospel, repent of our mistakes, and live in obedience to the counsel of our living prophets, we can overcome contention and begin again to progress back to God. When we through self-mastery, rise above the “natural man” and partake of the Atonement, we will eliminate contention and be partakers of the divine nature.</para>

			<para paraID="5">When I was growing up, there was one thing that I sure didn’t want to be known as—what in those days we called a “sissy,” or a gentle sort of guy. Instead, I wanted to be known as what we called “tough.” And I believe I could have been “tough” if it hadn’t been for some nontouch feelings that I had inside of me and the influence of my parents. It seems like they were forever pushing and pulling and loving me away from that kind of toughness.</para>
			<para paraID="6">At age fifteen I stayed out late one Saturday night like tough guys do. The next morning mother awoke me and told me it was time to go to priesthood meeting.</para>
			<para paraID="7">I rolled over and tried to go back to sleep.</para>
			<para paraID="8">A few minutes later my father came in from doing some early morning chores. I heard him proclaim in a loud voice, “If he isn’t going to priesthood meeting, there is a chicken coop that needs to be cleaned out.”</para>
			<para paraID="9">Hearing that, I bounded from my bed, and a few minutes later I was off to priesthood.</para>
			<para paraID="10">That is just one illustration of how my dad motivated or influenced me away from the course I sort of wanted to follow.</para>
			<para paraID="11">My mother was equally as “guilty” (or should I say responsible) for rearranging my life’s course. Once, while she and some other ladies were making a quilt in our front room, I was out in the kitchen. I could hear them talking about some of the tough things the students were doing at the high school. My mother finally said, “I don’t know if the other kids at the school are doing the things you say, but (then she raised her voice so that I could hear) I know my son George isn’t doing those things.”</para>
			<para paraID="12">I stopped what I was doing and thought to myself, “If she has faith in me, I can’t let her down.” I realized then—and many times since then—that it sure is hard to act tough when your mother doesn’t want you to.</para>
			<para paraID="13">When I was a college freshman, I still wanted to be tough and so my grades weren’t too good. I decided to quit school and get a car. I had for a long time felt that the right kind of car would give me a more “tough” appearance. But again my mother got in my way. She said, “Don’t quit school.”</para>
			<para paraID="14">I was firm and replied, “I’m quitting.”</para>
			<para paraID="15">She begged, “Don’t quit.”</para>
			<para paraID="16">I countered, “I’m quitting.”</para>
			<para paraID="17">She replied, “Don’t quit because what you are going to do in life you have to go to school to do.”</para>
			<para paraID="18">I asked, “What am I going to do in life?”</para>
			<para paraID="19">She answered, “I have no idea, but you must go to school to do it.”</para>
			<para paraID="20">Unconvinced, I held firm. “I’m quitting.”</para>
			<para paraID="21">She cried.</para>
			<para paraID="22">I couldn’t take it and said, “I was just kidding. I won’t quit.”</para>
			<para paraID="23">I’m sure glad they didn’t say, “How do we know what is good for George? He should choose for himself. We shouldn’t impose our will on him. Let him make up his own mind.”</para>
			<para paraID="24">My parents frequently got involved in my life. But now when I look back, I’m sure glad they did.</para>
			<para paraID="25">I’m grateful they believed that the Lord has given parents not only the right but also the responsibility to motivate, influence, teach, urge, pray, hope, persuade, reward, punish, love, and encourage their children to do right. And the best thing about it is that I feel they did it in a loving way. As a matter of fact, they were partners with Heavenly Father in all of this. Like him, they never forced me to choose the right. Instead, they loved me, told me the truth, acted in my interest, and wanted the best for me—not just for today but forever.</para>
			<para paraID="26">Now as a mother and father, Marilyn and I have decided to use the same approach.</para>
			<para paraID="27">Marilyn plays a very strong role in influencing the children. When we lived in Kentucky our oldest son, a junior in high school, wanted to go to Florida with the vast majority of students for spring vacation. She didn’t feel good about his going and told him so frankly. Because of her effective involvement, he didn’t go. It is my feeling that his not going on that trip has had a definite positive effect on his life’s course.</para>
			<para paraID="28">I remember when Marilyn called me at work and told me that she had persuaded our son not to go on the trip. I was deeply grateful that she had been so firm. I’m glad that, when so impressed, she is firm and unyielding in keeping our children moving toward good things. Sometimes the children think she is unbendable, but they know she loves them and is interested in their overall well-being more than she is in her own.</para>
			<para paraID="29">On the other hand, I’m more of a softy. Don’t blame me. Blame my parents. As I’ve already explained, they made me that way!</para>
			<para paraID="30">To motivate our family members I say, “Children, whoever does best in this activity gets a prize.”</para>
			<para paraID="31">They ask, “What is the prize?”</para>
			<para paraID="32">I reply, “You’ll see.”</para>
			<para paraID="33">They say, “Is it a kiss from you like usual?”</para>
			<para paraID="34">I smile, and they know they guessed right.</para>
			<para paraID="35">The only trouble with my approach is that they don’t seem to try to win. I suppose it is just because they aren’t competitors.</para>
			<para paraID="36">But kisses do work. At least the love that is behind kisses works. It amazes me how much influence we can have on our children if they know that we love them.</para>
			<para paraID="37">My mother didn’t cry to manipulate me to stay in college. She cried because she loved me, and it broke her heart to see me turn my back on what I <emphasis>could </emphasis>become. That’s why she cried. And I did as she wanted me to because deep down inside I knew why she cried.</para>
			<para paraID="38">But all parents love their children. Why then do some children rebel and go against the desires of their parents? I believe it is because sometimes out of love we begin to use<emphasis> force </emphasis>in our relationships with them. Have you noticed how forced things seldom seem to go the way you had hoped?</para>
			<para paraID="39">I know a seminary teacher who agreed at mid-term to allow a student who had been expelled from a high school class to enter his seminary class. On the first day the new student began attending, he walked in ten minutes late. He sat at the back, put his feet on an empty chair in front of him, and sneered at the teacher. All the other students had turned to watch the late arriver enter. Now that he was seated, all looked to see the teacher’s reaction. The teacher wanted to establish proper control from the beginning. He knew the time for force had come. He said, “You sit here in this chair on the front row.”</para>
			<para paraID="40">The student stared at the teacher but didn’t move.</para>
			<para paraID="41">The teacher, pointing at the chair but staring sternly at the student, spoke again, “Did you hear me? I want you here in front.”</para>
			<para paraID="42">Silence filled the room as all in the class saw the tension building up in the teacher.</para>
			<para paraID="43">Seconds passed and the student didn’t move.</para>
			<para paraID="44">“Get up here,” the teacher said with anger in his voice.</para>
			<para paraID="45">Still the student held his ground. In this time of crisis, the thought flashed into the teacher’s mind: “If I do not force him to come up, I will appear weak in the eyes of the other students, and I will lose face with them.”</para>
			<para paraID="46">The students continued to watch the teacher for his response to the situation. And then from somewhere the thought came to the teacher: “I am not here to use brute force or to save my face. I am here to save his.”</para>
			<para paraID="47">The teacher’s expression softened. A twinkle came into his eyes, followed by a smile. With this wonderful unspoken message came a relief from the cold war tension.</para>
			<para paraID="48">He spoke again, “All right, you stay there. But if at anytime in the future you ever want to sit up here, I’ll save this chair especially for you.”</para>
			<para paraID="49">Three weeks later the teacher hurried into the room just as the bell rang. As he began to call the roll, he looked out at the class and saw, not a foot away, the student grinning at him.</para>
			<para paraID="50">Many of us, especially parents, would have insisted that the young man move the first day. We make crises out of little things—as if there were no tomorrow. After all, we are the boss. That is our God-given right! (Or is it our Satan-influenced inclination?)</para>
			<para paraID="51">This wise teacher knew that it takes time to influence people. Time to show them that we love them. Time to establish trust. Time to show with our actions as well as our words that we do care.</para>
			<para paraID="52">And in the midst of an established and understood love, it is our duty to bring them onto the right path. We can and should use every godly approach to achieve this goal.</para>
			<para paraID="53">Can we use pressure to exert influence on our children? Of course we can. Our Heavenly Father does. We can say, “Our family has a great heritage. Grandfather and grandmother were always honest and good. We have a family of which we can be proud. Never do anything that will bring any shame or dishonor to the family’s name.” That’s putting pressure on them.</para>
			<para paraID="54">We can say, “Jason, you are twelve years of age and you are the oldest of our four sons. It is your duty to be a good example for the other three. Never do anything like cheating or lying or stealing that would cause the other boys to do wrong because of your example. I’m glad you are our oldest son because I’ve known for a long time that I can trust you and you will not let me down.” Is that pressure? Yes, it is.</para>
			<para paraID="55">We can say, “Boys, please don’t argue, because I love you both so much. It makes me feel upset. Please don’t argue.” That’s also pressure.</para>
			<para paraID="56">A heartbroken father can say as Alma did, “I can’t effectively teach others the gospel if you continue in your disobedience. They will have difficulty believing in the truthfulness of the gospel when they see you going in just the opposite direction from that which I’m teaching them. Please, son, for their sake and for your own, change your ways” (see <scriptureRef book="alma" chapter="39" verse="9-13">Alma 39:9–13</scriptureRef>). That’s pressure.</para>
			<para paraID="57">But in none of these is them any unrighteous force involved. The interest of the child is the primary concern.</para>
			<para paraID="58">Can we use rewards and punishments to exert influence? Yes. God uses rewards and punishments in his dealings with his children. He has said, “There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundation of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—</para>
			<para paraID="59">“And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="130" verse="20-21">D&amp;C 130:20–21</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="60">We can do the same. A promised story at bedtime, a trip to grandma’s, a ball game, a hike, and a party with ice cream and cake can make children want to do good things.</para>
			<para paraID="61">If I had a boy with potential who was failing in high school, I’d try all the motivation I could to get him interested. I’d tell him that if he’d get his grades up I’d take him fishing, or to a dinner at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, or to a major league ball game, or whatever else I thought might work but wouldn’t harm him.</para>
			<para paraID="62">Just think, if through a reward I could influence him to do better in school, it could change his entire life. If he said, “I’m just doing it for the reward,” I’d say, “That’s all right. Just do it.”</para>
			<para paraID="63">If I knew it wouldn’t cause rebellion, maybe I’d even be willing to try some appropriate discipline. “Son, if you don’t shape up in school, your mother will be over there three days a week to sit with you in class. I’ll be there the other two.” Or, “I don’t think you should go anywhere on any night until your homework is done.”</para>
			<para paraID="64">If that kind of discipline would work without causing worse problems, I’d use it. I’d rather use the rewards, but I feel a responsibility one way or the other to try to get him to do well in his school work, because to me far more is involved than just the grades.</para>
			<para paraID="65">If we begin to use strong influence based on love and firmness and rewards when children are young, we can avoid problems that occur down the road.</para>
			<para paraID="66">If we insist that a child go to Primary and make going pleasant through rewards and encouragement, then when the child is older he will be willing to attend seminary. Again, if we make seminary pleasant through encouragement, he will want to go on a mission. If we apply all the righteous pressure we can for him to go on a mission, he will likely marry in the temple.</para>
			<para paraID="67">We don’t take anyone’s free agency away by using loving pressure, firmness, appropriate punishment, and rewards. In fact, if we don’t use these approaches, Satan may soon entice them to give their agency to him.</para>
			<para paraID="68">For example, unrighteous advertising leads one to believe that manhood and cigarette smoking are synonymous, that beautiful people can live together without being married, that immorality is just part of growing up. Some teachers portray the point of view that those who are religious are naive and bigoted, that to believe in a creation of the world by God is ridiculous. Those enticements can cause people to choose Satan’s way—and that way inevitably leads to entrapment and sorrow.</para>
			<para paraID="69">Satan will remain the master influencer unless we enter the battle on the other side. His techniques are based on lies such as, “Ye shall not surely die” (<scriptureRef book="moses" chapter="4" verse="10">Moses 4:10</scriptureRef>). Truth ultimately wins if it is presented. But it must be presented.</para>
			<para paraID="70">As we strive to influence others, we must constantly examine our motives. If any influence we exert on others is based upon selfish benefits for ourselves, then we leave the Lord’s camp and operate on Satan’s ground. I recall once when I was serving as a mission president, a young missionary was having emotional problems of quite a serious nature. I had called the family and the local Church leaders. They seemed to feel that if I handled things correctly the boy’s problems could be solved. I tried everything I could, and still the problems worsened.</para>
			<para paraID="71">I began to feel as though I was a failure. I knew that many important people knew of the case, and I wondered what they would think of me if I couldn’t solve the problem. My personal pride became a subtle but real factor.</para>
			<para paraID="72">One night I could not sleep for my mind was going like a speeded-up phonograph record asking over and over, “What will people think if you lose this missionary?” Finally, in desperation I threw off the covers and arose from my bed. I went out under a large tree in front of the mission home. The hour was late and I was alone. I knelt and prayed with all the energy of my soul for peace of mind. In response, a voice in my heart said, “Why are you so desperate? Your concern is with yourself and your own pride. Forget yourself and help the missionary.”</para>
			<para paraID="73">With that great insight I suddenly felt a release from the despair. I focused my prayer in a different direction. Thereafter I had the freedom that comes when we strive to serve another more than ourselves.</para>
			<para paraID="74">Because of the strong influence we can sometimes have on someone who knows that we love him and who trusts us, we should be extremely cautious in what we do. We should ever remember that decisions must be made by the individual and not by us. We can take him near a decision but we must not push him, even if he is totally willing, to make our decision rather than his own.</para>
			<para paraID="75">God has said, “No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by longsuffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="121" verse="41">D&amp;C 121:41</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="76">To ensure that we do not go too far, we must influence others as guided by the genre whisperings of the Spirit. And we must seek to influence our children so that the Spirit becomes the greatest influence in their lives, not us. This principle is shown in a case of a father whose son is a fine athlete. There was much pressure on this young man not to serve a mission. Many felt that he could do more good by playing ball and using that great fame that comes from so doing to influence others, especially the young admiring fans who would listen to and follow his every word.</para>
			<para paraID="77">But the father felt that his son should serve a mission. Because of the relationship of love and mutual respect that existed between the two, he felt that he had an unusually great influence on the boy. Thus, he felt that, if he chose to do so, he could talk the boy into going on a mission.</para>
			<para paraID="78">The father searched his own soul, for he had heard people say, “You seem to feel that missions are important. What about your son? Is he going?” At times it was almost as if the father were on trial.</para>
			<para paraID="79">One day the two were eating dinner after a practice in which the son had played exceptionally well. The son spoke, “Father, things sure look promising for me in athletics. What should I do about a mission?”</para>
			<para paraID="80">The father replied, “That’s up to you.”</para>
			<para paraID="81">“Yeah, but how do you feel?”</para>
			<para paraID="82">“Son, it’s up to you. It’s your life. It’s not what I feel but what you feel.”</para>
			<para paraID="83">The son seemed almost disappointed and silently continued eating.</para>
			<para paraID="84">The father attempted to sit in silence, but after a few seconds he felt the inward promptings that come from a divine source. He could not restrain himself and said softly but with considerable power, “Son, let me tell you how I feel. I have dreamed all my adult life that each of my sons would serve a mission. And you would be such a great missionary. You’d be far better at that than you are at playing ball.”</para>
			<para paraID="85">The son was no longer eating. His knife and fork were set aside. He looked deep into his father’s eyes.</para>
			<para paraID="86">The father continued, “Son, I love you with all my heart. And I love the Lord. The Lord needs you out there, not here. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true. God lives. Go tell the world that.”</para>
			<para paraID="87">The son replied, “Dad, I feel that you are right.”</para>
			<para paraID="88">After a few seconds of silence, the father spoke again, “But, son, it’s your life. It isn’t what I think that matters.”</para>
			<para paraID="89">“Yes it is, Dad. What you think really matters. I’m glad you told me just how you feel. I really felt the Spirit as you spoke.”</para>
			<para paraID="90">He continued, “I need to get away by myself and think.”</para>
			<para paraID="91">Did the father go too far? The son had such a promising future as an athlete. Was the father concerned with his own effectiveness as a father more than with the boy’s future in sports? Did the father apply too much pressure? On the other hand, how can you help applying pressure when you love someone, when you have feelings, when you feel prompted by the Spirit to state those feelings?</para>
			<para paraID="92">I asked the father if he felt like he had manipulated his son who has now decided to go on his mission, He replied, “I don’t know. I’ve wondered about that myself so I wrote him a letter and asked him how he felt about it.” He then showed me this reply from his son:</para>
			<para paraID="93">“Dear father:</para>
			<para paraID="94">“You asked if you had manipulated me to go on a mission. I suppose that means, did you put pressure on me to go?</para>
			<para paraID="95">“You sure did. But it wasn’t the pressure of your words. It was the pressure of your example. All my life you have shown me by the way you lived that I should go.</para>
			<para paraID="96">“Dad, you’ve never really forced me to do anything, but you’ve always let me know the right way.</para>
			<para paraID="97">“You didn’t pressure me or manipulate me. One of the main reasons that I’m going is because I know that you want me to. And I also know God wants me to. But the real reason why I’m going is because I want to.”</para>
			<para paraID="98">Yes, as a boy I had many of the makings of being a tough guy. I believe I would have made it if my parents had just let me go. But because of their constant interference or motivation or influence, I turned from that to the truths of the gospel. And I have found that the gentle course is the way my soul desired to go all along.</para>
			<para paraID="99">Now, as parents, we try to be sure to let our children know that if they don’t want to go to Church, there’s a chicken coop that needs cleaning. That way they will choose Church and won’t get all fowled up!</para>

			<para paraID="6">The term <emphasis>priesthood council </emphasis>is not unfamiliar to Latter-day Saints. Indeed, it is almost a sacred term. We hold in sanctity the reference to the <emphasis>Council </emphasis>of the Twelve Apostles and the <emphasis>Council </emphasis>of the First Presidency. We sustain councils at various levels of Church administration because we know they were authorized by God’s servants.</para>
			<para paraID="7">Even before we came to this earth we were familiar with priesthood councils. Then, here in mortality, we have had reintroduced to us the concept of Church government through councils at every level. We must ever keep before us the purpose of priesthood councils: <emphasis>to help lead the individual and the family back to our Heavenly Father.</emphasis></para>
			<para paraID="8">Now, the Church has defined for us its broad areas of general emphasis, namely missionary work, genealogy, temporal welfare, and spiritual welfare. These four areas provide points of emphasis for individual and family exaltation. Through the use of councils we can help members of the Church to grow and develop in these areas. Let me give some examples of how this may be done.</para>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="9">Priesthood Councils and Personal Histories</title>
				<para paraID="10">At regular intervals, in First Quorum of the Seventy weekly meetings we ask a member of the quorum to give a ten-minute autobiographical sketch of his life. We learn many tender, spiritual, sweet, and moving details from the lives of our Brethren. Suppose General Authority Executive Administrators invited a Regional Representative to come to the next area council meeting prepared to share uplifting incidents from his life. And suppose you were that Regional Representative. As you prepared by recording these matters in writing, and then as you shared them with the other council members, would you not have created a brief personal history? Would it not be a wise use of part of the area council time to actually accomplish the task—in this case, writing personal histories—with council members rather than expending all the time creating programs to influence others? Perhaps we have looked beyond the mark. This is a small field to carefully cultivate as we keep before us larger fields.</para>
				<para paraID="11">Suppose this same procedure was in turn used in your regional council meeting until your stake presidents had all shared these intimate spiritual experiences. Wouldn’t that bind that council more closely together as well as accomplish the goal of emphasizing personal history? Do you think your stake presidents would catch the vision to duplicate this in their stake council meetings or when they meet with bishops? Would the bishops then in turn inspire their ward council members? Would the Relief Society president take this to her organization? Would not the elders president lead his quorum members to this same goal? And might not the home teachers catch the spirit of blessing those families and single members in their care by inviting them, through the father where applicable, to share in an organized way some of the sacred moments of heavenward movement in their lives?</para>
				<para paraID="12">President Kimball has asked that we prepare personal histories. Could priesthood councils help facilitate this task?</para>
			</topic>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="13">Priesthood Councils and Missionary Work</title>
				<para paraID="14">Consider other points of emphasis for us as priesthood leaders. In our missionary opportunities, suppose we shared in an area council meeting the name and a brief sketch of the family we are friendshipping. Suppose in council meetings we periodically asked stake presidents to share their families’ progress with fellowshipping. Could this same process be used in the ecclesiastical flow from the area council to the visit of the home teachers where they would learn of the prayer-inspired selection of a nonmember family?</para>
			</topic>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="15">Priesthood Councils, Home Storage, and Reactivation</title>
				<para paraID="16">What about the year’s supply? Could there be a logical plan adapted to the needs and abilities of that particular council? Perhaps council members could cooperate in adding a commodity to their individual storage on a regular basis until <emphasis>all </emphasis>am motivated to move forward in this area of individual emphasis.</para>
				<para paraID="17">Has your council accepted President Kimball’s encouragement that each family regularly help an inactive family or individual come into full activity? Could priesthood councils work in the way outlined above to stimulate priesthood quorums, home teachers, and Relief Society sisters to better train fathers and mothers in the activation of another family?</para>
				<para paraID="18">May we suggest that on your council agenda you give priority to items that report upon or train in missionary or genealogical work and temporal or spiritual welfare?</para>
				<para paraID="19">At the same time as we renew our effectiveness in Church councils, we should also seek to do better in family councils. Yes, brethren, we all need to put aside our ecclesiastical titles and remember our eternal callings as fathers. We should prayerfully examine the Church’s basic points of emphasis to see where we—father and mother—need to give attention, and in our own family councils, decide where to place our emphasis.</para>
				<para paraID="20">Do you see what is being suggested? It is called Church government by example. You know as I know that a stake presidency or bishopric will never inspire their stake or ward members to do something they are too busy to do themselves. I am impressed by the example offered by President Ezra Taft Benson who completed his family histories and four-generation program before he addressed the Church on this subject in October 1978. Church government by example!</para>

			<para paraID="3">To most Americans, the word <emphasis>Vietnam </emphasis>merely recalls unhappy memories that are best forgotten. The decade of the 1960s, during which the Vietnam War was at its height, was a time of domestic turmoil and discontent in the United States as well as in Southeast Asia. But woven through “the dark tapestry of war,” as Elder Gordon B. Hinckley described it, was a “silver thread, small but radiant with hope” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1968, p. 24). That silver thread was the gospel of Jesus Christ.</para>

				<title paraID="4">Early Missionary Work in Vietnam</title>
				<para paraID="5">While the war grew in intensity during the early 1960s, a few Latter-day Saint servicemen were sent to Vietnam to act as advisers to the South Vietnamese forces. Thus, 30 June 1962 President Robert S. Taylor of the Southern Far East Mission organized the first LDS servicemen’s group in Saigon, with Cecil L. Cavender as group leader. The work of this small group of a little over fifty Saints was impressive. They shared the gospel not only with American service personnel, but also with their Vietnamese associates. Before the end of 1962, one American and two Vietnamese sisters, Duong Thuy Van and Nguygen Thi Thuy, had joined the Church. Sister Van later translated <emphasis>Joseph Smith’s Testimony, </emphasis>the first Church publication in the Vietnamese language.<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="6">The buildup of American troops continued during the next three years. In May 1965 President Jay A. Quealy, who succeeded President Taylor, set Harper K. Morris apart as LDS servicemen’s coordinator in South Vietnam. Soon after his appointment, Brother Morris organized a servicemen’s group at Bien Hoa, fifteen miles from Saigon. The Bien Hoa Group, the first of many similar groups outside Saigon, constructed its own chapel before that year ended.</para>
				<para paraID="7">By December 1965 there were 1,500 LDS servicemen in Vietnam. President Keith E. Garner, succeeding President Quealy, made South Vietnam one of the four zones of the Southern Far East Mission, and divided it into three districts. At the same time, the president of the Southern District called six men to act as district missionaries. They had success with other Americans, as well as with the Vietnamese. By February 1966, thirty Vietnamese were numbered among the Saints.</para>
				<para paraID="8">After February 1965, the buildup of American troops was rapid. By May 1966, there were an estimated 2,200 LDS military people in the country, organized into twenty groups and one branch (Saigon). Although the number of Vietnamese Saints was growing, far more women than men joined the Church. Many Vietnamese women, employed by the United States military or government as secretaries, receptionists, cooks, or housegirls, were brought into the Church by LDS personnel for whom they worked. Vietnamese men, on the other hand, frequently worked away from home or in the Vietnamese armed forces, and so were not easily available to those who carried the gospel message.</para>
				<para paraID="9">On 2 October 1966, Nguyen Cao Minh, the first Vietnamese elder, was ordained. He had been converted to the Church in Biloxi, Mississippi, while training for a military assignment in 1963. In the estimation of some, Brother Minh “had the most far-reaching good effect on the Church in Vietnam of any Vietnamese member of the Church. In spite of military assignments that often kept him away from Saigon, Brother Minh gave over ten years of leadership to the Vietnamese priesthood holders and continually encouraged the translation and missionary work.”<noteMarker noteRef="2">2</noteMarker></para>

				<title paraID="10">The Dedication of South Vietnam for Missionary Work</title>
				<para paraID="11">Church leaders in Salt Lake City and Hong Kong kept a careful eye on the LDS servicemen in Vietnam. As their numbers grow, General Authorities, particularly Elder Ezra Taft Benson, Elder Gordon B. Hinckley, Elder Marion D. Hanks, and Bishop Victor L. Brown, visited South Vietnam to encourage them to remain faithful to their families and the Church. On such a visit in October 1966, Elder Hinckley and Elder Hanks arrived in Vietnam with instructions from President David O. McKay to dedicate South Vietnam for the preaching of the restored gospel if they were impressed by the Spirit to do so.</para>
				<para paraID="12">There were several reasons Vietnam looked so promising as a mission field. One was that ten or eleven percent of the people were already Christian—possibly the highest percentage of Christians in any Asian nation except the Philippines. A high percentage of the people were not followers of Buddhism or other Eastern religions.</para>
				<para paraID="13">Thus after visiting with servicemen at conferences in Da Nang and Nha Trang, the visiting authorities met on October 30 with 205 Church members and friends in the Caravelle Hotel in downtown Saigon. As he spoke, Elder Hinckley informed the congregation that President McKay had authorized him to dedicate South Vietnam for missionary work. He offered a beautiful, exceptionally appropriate dedicatory prayer: “We have seen in other parts of Asia,” he prayed, “the manner in which thou hast turned the hand and the work of the adversary to the good and the blessing of many of thy children. And now we call upon thee at this time that thou wilt similarly pour out thy Spirit upon this land.” He pleaded with the Lord that there might be peace, and that freedom-loving men might be allowed their free agency. He asked that an added measure of the Lord’s Spirit might be poured out upon both the nonmembers and those who already had the gospel, that the people might be more willing to listen to the message of the Savior, and that the members would be more eager to share the gospel. He also asked the Lord to “open the way for the coming of missionaries, and make their labors fruitful of great and everlasting good in the lives of the people” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1968, pp. 22–23).</para>
				<para paraID="14">Dedicating a land during a time of war for the preaching of the gospel is not the Church’s usual practice. Traditionally the Church has dedicated countries when missionary work is about to commence or shortly after it has started—and the usual pattern is to remove missionaries from areas of active warfare, not to send them in. Nevertheless, Elder Hinckley, along with the mission president over the area and the servicemen who led the Church in Vietnam, felt that this was a different situation. Somehow, notwithstanding the grim horror of war, they expected the gospel to be established in Vietnam. In Elder Hinckley’s general conference address of April 1968, he said:</para>
				<para paraID="15">“I make no defense of the war from this pulpit. … I seek only to call your attention to that silver thread, small but radiant with hope, shining through the dark tapestry of war—namely, the establishment of a bridgehead, small and frail now; but which somehow, under the mysterious ways of God, will be strengthened, and from which someday shall spring forth a great work affecting for good the lives of large numbers of our Father’s children who live in that part of the world. Of that I have a certain faith” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1968, p. 24).</para>
				<para paraID="16">Elder Hinckley visited Vietnam in 1966, 1967, and 1968. He was torn inside by the pain and suffering he observed. But in the midst of the misery, he observed true manhood. In 1966 he said, “No more faithful members are found anywhere in the world than among our servicemen.”<noteMarker noteRef="3">3</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="17">American involvement in the Vietnam War reached its peak in 1968. In that year over five thousand LDS servicemen were assigned to Vietnam. They made up sixty groups and branches. Six LDS chaplains were assigned there. In order to help and supervise Church activities, President Garner, and later Presidents W. Brent Hardy and William S. Bradshaw, who also served as mission presidents over the area, visited the war zone at least every other month, and usually monthly. (South Vietnam was part of four missions during its history: Southern Far East, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong—Taiwan, and Hong Kong.) All three men found the work exhausting because of the intense pace that was required, but also highly rewarding as they met and counseled with servicemen, local Saints, and investigators.</para>
				<para paraID="18">Saints living in wartime South Vietnam remember the Church’s efforts to serve them: “There were many evidences of deep concern for the Saints among the leaders of the Church on all levels. Elder Hinckley arranged for special Church films and films of conference sessions to be sent regularly to the servicemen. KSL conducted special interviews with LDS servicemen geared specifically for Utah audiences. The zone presidency arranged for a special Christmas message to come from the First Presidency of the Church to the servicemen. District meetings were often held to plan ways to incorporate Vietnamese members into the full workings of the branch. There was a continual concern for helping the Vietnamese Saints become more capable of leading themselves.”<noteMarker noteRef="4">4</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="19">Church activities among the servicemen were conducted in a manner remarkably similar to those at home, especially considering the circumstances of war. Home teaching visits were made, family home evenings were held, and church services were conducted.</para>
				<para paraID="20">When the U.S. government began removing troops from Vietnam in 1971, the Church increased its efforts to prepare local leaders to operate the Church. With this in mind, on 24 May 1971, Southern District President Myrne R. Riley called Nguyen Cao Minh, the first local elder, to be the first Vietnamese president of the Saigon Branch. Minh was released several months later because of a new military assignment, but his successor, Ralph Kurihara, selected two other Vietnamese elders, Nguyen Van The and Dang Thong Nhat, as his counselors.</para>

				<title paraID="21">The Era of Full-time Missionary Work in Saigon</title>
				<para paraID="22">William S. Bradshaw became president of the Hong Kong Mission, which included South Vietnam, during the summer of 1971. From the time of his first visit to Vietnam, he recognized the growing need to bring full-time missionaries into the country, largely to take the place of the departing servicemen. He met with Phan The Ngoc, an attorney who had obtained legal recognition for the Church in 1967, and gained assurance that the Church still had the right to exist and own property. On obtaining this assurance, President Bradshaw wrote in March 1972 to U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker to ascertain whether there were any problems or obstacles from an American point of view. Finally, in November, President Bradshaw received a reply from Ambassador Bunker. It contained much legal information that was of worth, but more important was its positive tone, which led President Bradshaw to believe that there was nothing in particular to worry about. Saigon was quite secure, even though there were sometimes battles only fifteen or twenty miles away.</para>
				<para paraID="23">In early 1973, the warring powers announced a cease-fire and the forthcoming withdrawal of all American military personnel. Soon afterwards, President Bradshaw began receiving notes from Church leaders in Salt Lake City, asking what the status of the Church and particularly the Saigon Branch would be when the withdrawal of the LDS servicemen was complete.</para>
				<para paraID="24">With these questions on his mind, in late February 1973 President Bradshaw went to Vietnam. He asked again the questions he had been asking for over a year: What’s the prognosis for the war? Are the Vietnamese going to be strong enough to hold? Within the Church, what are the prospects for good housing for missionaries? What about medical care? How many LDS American government people will be on hand to lend stability to the branch and the work of the missionaries? What about missionary security?</para>
				<para paraID="25">Before President Bradshaw left Saigon on February 26, he was satisfied that all conditions were positive or at least satisfactory. Before leaving for Hong Kong, he pleaded with the Lord for a confirmation of his positive feelings. “What came,” President Bradshaw later said, “was an affirmation of our feelings and a very sweet peace concerning the future of the Church in South Vietnam.”<noteMarker noteRef="5">5</noteMarker> This feeling removed all reservations from his mind. He wrote to Elder Hinckley the day after returning to Hong Kong and firmly recommended that missionaries be sent. He also mentioned the high quality of the branch facilities and the housing that was available for the elders, and he described the American brethren who would be remaining in Saigon—men such as Dr. Lester Bush, a physician who was connected with the U.S. embassy, and several others.</para>
				<para paraID="26">President Bradshaw described the events of the next two weeks: “A few days intervened … and then I wrote on March 7 a formal letter to the Missionary Committee restating all the things that I had written Elder Hinckley privately. On March 13 I received this letter from the Missionary Committee over the signature of Elder Hinckley: ‘Dear President Bradshaw, Your letter … concerning the work in Saigon was read to the First Presidency and the Twelve. After consideration of the matter, it was determined that you might be permitted to send four missionaries to Saigon.’ That’s as far as I got in the letter when I literally shouted for joy. I really did, and the missionaries who were in the office came running to see who had shot me.”</para>
				<para paraID="27">After President Bradshaw calmed down, he read the rest of the letter, which included some precautions. Among other requirements, the Brethren suggested that he obtain the written approval of the parents of the missionaries who were to go to Saigon.</para>
				<para paraID="28">The letters from the parents were obtained, and on 6 April 1973, President Bradshaw, in company with Elders James Christeansen, Richard Holloman, David Posey, and Colin Van Orman, flew to Saigon. The elders began formal study of Vietnamese the next day, and on April 8 President Bradshaw reorganized the Saigon Branch presidency. Nguyen Van The was set apart as branch president, with Dang Thong Nhat and Lester Bush as counselors. The membership was around ninety-five, including four active Melchizedek Priesthood holders and six or seven Aaronic Priesthood bearers.</para>
				<para paraID="29">With only a few exceptions, the elders followed the normal proselyting procedures of LDS missionaries. They learned the language quickly and associated freely with the people, even though the evidence of war was ever present in the rolls of barbed wire along most streets and the armed guards at every corner of the city. Occasionally they heard sniper fire, and acts of sabotage destroyed buildings. The sky was sometimes black with smoke of burning oil and other material, but the elders were hampered little in their work.</para>
				<para paraID="30">They did not tract. It wasn’t considered wise—and was unnecessary: the missionaries had many referrals from local members and from servicemen who had returned to the United States. They had no trouble meeting people in public places, on buses, or in English language classes that they organized and taught.</para>
				<para paraID="31">Unlike Indonesia, where the elders began translating Church books and literature after entering the country, local Vietnamese members and American government personnel, who had formerly served missions in Hong Kong and had learned the Vietnamese language, had begun translating Church materials into Vietnamese as early as 1963. By the early 1970s, a number of tracts, pamphlets, and other items were in print in Vietnamese. In 1970, President Hardy had established an official translation committee and set apart Sister Cong Ton Nu Tuong Vy as head translator. Sister Vy, a former university professor of aristocratic heritage, translated the Book of Mormon into Vietnamese, a project that was well under way by 1972. President Bradshaw had also assigned members in Saigon to translate the six-lesson missionary plan before the elders entered the country.</para>
				<para paraID="32">The elders soon recognized a need to adapt the standard missionary lessons to the Vietnamese audience. Not having a Judeo-Christian background, most Vietnamese could not understand references to prophets, apostles, revelations, angels, God, and Christ, all of which are referred to in the first discussion. The elders created special lessons or explanations to supplement the regular lessons. Until they mastered the Vietnamese language, however, it took the elders three or four hours to deliver each lesson. At first, they needed six months to teach the full set of discussions.</para>
				<para paraID="33">During 1973 and 1974, Sister Vy completed her translation of the Book of Mormon, and the translation committee approved the final manuscript. President Bradshaw made fifty copies of the manuscript and distributed them to the members and missionaries in May 1974. This was an unusual procedure, but it proved to be wise in the long run. During 1974 the translation committee also completed Vietnamese versions of the Doctrine and Covenants, and Elder LeGrand Richards’s <emphasis>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder.</emphasis></para>
				<para paraID="34">In July 1974, Jerry D. Wheat, new president of the Hong Kong Mission, toured Vietnam for the first time. Over one hundred and fifty members attended a conference at that time. A significant fact was that adults outnumbered youths, and males and females were nearly equal in number. A year before, when the missionaries were first in Saigon, youths and females had considerably outnumbered adults and males. The emphasis the elders had placed on working with families had borne fruit.</para>
				<para paraID="35">Tension in the war began to mount during the fall of 1974. The South Vietnamese government regularly reminded Saigon residents of the atrocities committed by the Viet Cong. The evidences of war came ever closer as rocket fire seriously damaged Bien Hoa Air Base and word of skirmishes in the countryside reached the elders and members. On November 1, the U.S. embassy issued a warning to all Americans to stay off the streets of Saigon because of large demonstrations, violence, and political disturbances. By this time, however, the elders knew the streets of the city better than most Americans, and by avoiding large crowds and trouble spots they were able to continue their work.</para>
				<para paraID="36">In mid January 1975, three new elders arrived in Saigon. They brought to fifteen the total number of missionaries to serve in Vietnam. About the same time, however, the public transportation system began to fail. This made proselyting more difficult, but by giving more lessons at the branch chapel, the elders increased the number of people they were teaching. Ironically, as the threat of a Communist takeover grew, the number of Vietnamese who desired to learn of the restored gospel also grew rapidly. During February and March 1975, proselyting success was at its height. New converts were joining the Church regularly. There were close to three hundred members in Vietnam by the end of March.</para>

				<title paraID="37">Withdrawal from Vietnam</title>
				<para paraID="38">On March 31, however, Louis Eldredge, an active and helpful Saint who worked for the U.S. government in Saigon, called President Wheat and strongly suggested that the missionaries apply for re-entry visas into Hong Kong. President Wheat, who had plotted the movements of the Communist forces on a map, had made a previous decision to remove the elders from Vietnam as soon as the Communists were within one hundred miles of Saigon. Two days later, after considerable difficulty, he was able to make airline reservations for seven of the elders on April 3 and for the other two on the following day. Concerning these events, President Wheat wrote:</para>
				<para paraID="39">“If I was not on the phone, I was on my knees, giving deep consideration to what this would do to the morale of the missionaries, to the members, and everyone concerned. I felt very sick inside to think that we would have to move our missionaries out when they had thirty or forty people ready to be baptized in the next three weeks. The missionary work had never prospered as it had the last three or four weeks. Yet I knew the feelings of the parents having their missionaries there under such conditions.”<noteMarker noteRef="6">6</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="40">In Saigon the elders were, in a sense, unaware of the seriousness of their circumstances. They believed that the current problems would blow over and that they would be able to continue their work. Had it not been for the visit of an LDS civilian, who ran into the chapel and yelled, “Elders, get out of here!” and a call from Sister Eldredge, saying, “You had better prepare your visas and get out of here,” the elders might have questioned President Wheat when he called and ordered them from the country. Almost miraculously they were all able to complete the necessary paper work in time to leave the country on their scheduled flights. The last two elders to leave, Elders Bowman and Oviatt, destroyed all American-influenced materials and brought the branch records with them to Hong Kong. By the end of April, Saigon fell to the Communists.</para>
				<para paraID="41">From April 4 on, President The devoted almost full time to the needs and concerns of the members. By phone calls, President Wheat and Elder Richard T. Bowman kept him informed about changes in the war and plans for the evacuation of the Vietnamese members. On April 16, President Wheat and Elder Bowman flew to Saigon and held a brief conference with the branch. Over one hundred and fifty members showed up on short notice, verifying the effectiveness of a communications network President The had formed among them.</para>
				<para paraID="42">But President Wheat’s visit was hard on him and the members. He was under strict orders from the U.S. embassy not to discuss evacuation plans with anyone but President The. Some members thought the mission president was trying to make them feel overly secure. Others asked why the elders had not stayed and risked their lives to save them as many other Americans were doing for their friends and congregations.</para>
				<para paraID="43">Although their actions were largely unknown to the members, President Wheat, along with Elder Bowman and President The, had been spending almost every waking hour working on membership lists and lists of investigators who were closely aligned with the Church. These lists, accepted by the U.S. government, became the basis for evacuation priority ratings. Government priorities were as follows: (1) U.S. citizens and their families, (2) high echelon officers in the Vietnamese military and government, (3) Vietnamese employees of the U.S. government and of U.S. contractors, and (4) individuals who had been working with any U.S. organization and could obtain affidavits for evacuation. Most of the Saigon Branch members fell into the fourth category.<noteMarker noteRef="7">7</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="44">A few members got out of the country during the week prior to April 27, the last Sunday LDS services were held in Saigon. But most of the Saints gathered on that day to receive instructions and make plans for leaving their native land. The confusion caused by several desperate members finally urged Nguyen Cao Minh to stand and chastise the congregation and to plead with them to humbly support President The. The meeting proceeded in reverence, and the sacrament was administered for the last time.</para>
				<para paraID="45">Several families went directly to the airport after the meeting. Spaces on the planes were extremely limited because of the low priority assigned to the members of the Church, but at least five LDS families made their way into the airport just before the April 28 Communist massive shelling of the air base and the resultant twenty-four-hour curfew. President The and several other prominent LDS families were trapped in the city because of the unexpected rapidity of the Communist takeover. Saigon fell on April 30.</para>
				<para paraID="46">Only a little over one hundred Vietnamese Saints are known to have left the country during the evacuation. Among the Saints who remained with President The in Vietnam were Nguyen Cao Minh, Sister Vy, Le Van Kha (second counselor in the branch presidency), Brother Pho and his family, and Nguyen Hai Chau and his family. Brother Thinh, one who escaped, asserted that among the group left behind were many of the most faithful and most deserving members.</para>
				<para paraID="47">Those Saints who were evacuated were taken to refugee camps in the United States, generally to Camp Pendleton, California, where the Church established a branch. Before many months passed, they found their way into the stream of American life by obtaining new jobs and places to live. The Church found sponsors for eighty-three Vietnamese members, and other agencies helped a few others.</para>
				<para paraID="48">But what of those who remained behind? After 30 April 1975 it was as though a light went out, leaving everyone in darkness. By April 1977, Sister The, who had settled in Provo, Utah, had received only one letter from her husband. Although Sister Vy was more successful in getting letters out of Vietnam, she was unable to say much that cast light on the situation.</para>
				<para paraID="49">Since then, however, some remarkable things have happened. Following many months of political indoctrination and re-education, President The, Brother Minh, and many other Saints have managed to escape from Vietnam. They, like hundreds of other Vietnamese who could not endure life in Communist Vietnam, took to the sea in overloaded boats. They became part of the so-called “boat people” who continue to cause so much humanitarian concern for the international community. Brothers The and Minh are now living in Utah. It is estimated that ninety percent of the active Vietnamese Saints are now in the United States.</para>
				<para paraID="50">Some members have wondered why Vietnam fell to the Communists, particularly since it had been dedicated for the preaching of the gospel. Actually, the question is naive. Dedicatory prayers are just that—prayers, not commands. Such prayers do not impose the Lord’s will on mankind; rather, they bless the efforts of the Lord’s servants. Consider how many decades passed before Elder David O. McKay’s dedication of the Chinese realm in 1921 was fulfilled to any degree.</para>
				<para paraID="51">The Church has continued its interest in the Vietnamese people since the fall of Saigon. In April 1975, President Spencer W. Kimball visited the refugees at Camp Pendleton, California. Around 1,000 Vietnamese, mostly nonmembers, have settled in Utah. According to President The, almost 80,000 Vietnamese are residing in California. There are almost as many Vietnamese in California as there are Tongans in Tonga. Three native Vietnamese have been assigned as full-time missionaries to their own people in the California Los Angeles Mission.</para>
				<para paraID="52">On 23 March 1980, the Salt Lake Stake organized a Vietnamese branch with Minh Cao Nguyen as President, and Luc Pham and Dung Nguyen as counselors. The twenty-five members have found themselves outnumbered by as much as three-to-one by investigators. Missionaries of the Utah Salt Lake City Mission are assigned to work with the nonmembers. A Vietnamese branch has also been approved for the Provo area. Currently around twenty Utah Valley Vietnamese investigators hold a Sunday School class as part of the Asian Branch at Brigham Young University.</para>
				<para paraID="53">The Church has continued to produce Vietnamese language material, even though the country was closed to active missionary work. Seventeen tracts, a hymnbook, <emphasis>Selections from the Book of Mormon, </emphasis>and <emphasis>Gospel Principles </emphasis>are in print. The Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, plus three leadership manuals, are translated and are ready for typesetting. Other manuals have been approved.</para>
				<para paraID="54">Perhaps we should think again about the parable of the sower, or the parable of the soils, as it is sometimes called. To the list of soils the Savior mentioned might be added another kind, that which is initially rich but is destroyed through the misdeeds of evil stewards. Perhaps that is the situation in Vietnam. How much time will be required for the Lord to restore the soil for another planting of the gospel seed is known only to him.</para>

					<title paraID="1">Our Sabbaths seem to be long and boring to our small children. What can we do to promote happy Sabbaths?</title>
				</titleBlock>
				<bodyBlock>
					<para paraID="2"><strong>Sharon and Wayne Dequer, parents of three children, Monrovia Ward, Arcadia California Stake</strong> The Savior clearly taught that the Sabbath is a day to distinguish between idle wants and real spiritual and physical needs. Little children are irrepressibly active, and we must recognize that need in planning their Sabbaths. Rather than asking “<emphasis>Should</emphasis> they be active on Sunday?” we could probably more appropriately ask, “<emphasis>How</emphasis> should they be active on Sunday?”</para>
					<para paraID="3">We want our children to learn that Sunday is a day for being able to do different things than we get to do the rest of the week. They can readily see that daddy doesn’t go to work or mow the lawn on the Sabbath, and mommy doesn’t shop or clean or bake cookies—we do different, more restful things. How can the day be different for our children as well?</para>
					<para paraID="4">First of all, we save Sunday as a day to be together with just our own family, rather than a day to play with friends or to spend watching television. Then it’s up to mom and dad to make it an interesting and enjoyable day. To accomplish that, instead of stressing the “shalt nots,” we begin teaching our little ones to ask—and answer—the question, “Is it appropriate?”</para>
					<para paraID="5">That question led us to such activities as reading, coloring, singing, and playing musical instruments. But while these seemed to be quite appropriate, they didn’t go far enough to stretch through the day. So then we learned to turn to other ideas: helping one of our children “write” a letter, acting as scribe for another while he dictated a page in his personal history, having personal interviews with each child, just talking together and sharing thoughts and ideas.</para>
					<para paraID="6">Low-key creative play, we feel, is entirely fitting on the Sabbath. The question of appropriateness can generally be answered by looking at the amount of preparation and clean-up work a particular activity requires. We also choose games that are different from those normally shared with friends. We’ve decided that playing in the dirt, for instance, isn’t a Sunday activity, but blocks and other construction games seem more acceptable. And they can be tied in with the gospel. So after reading the story of Noah’s ark or Lehi’s journey to the New World, we can have each of the children build his own representation of their ships.</para>
					<para paraID="7">The key to helping our children have an enjoyable Sabbath seems to be our spending time with them. Certainly other Sunday activities also demand our time, but a half hour here and there with our children, strategically placed, goes a long way. Many families find that walking to church, at least part of the way, really helps the children sit restfully and quietly when they arrive. We have also made a special effort to help our children appreciate Sunday church services. Here, again, the question of appropriateness has proven useful. Quiet toys and coloring books are valuable for occupying the littlest ones, but of course they must be closely monitored, since nearby children and even adults find these distracting. We always rejoice when we find a book that is gospel-centered; those we use only in church and at other special times. The child soon learns that the book is different from his other books and hopefully will associate <emphasis>church</emphasis> and <emphasis>reverence</emphasis> with it.</para>
					<para paraID="8">We feel we must begin this training as early as possible. A toddler’s cooperation span may be frustratingly short, so we encourage him or her with “when-you’re-big enough-to-stay-in-the-meeting-with-the-rest-of-the-family” comments.</para>
					<para paraID="9">The occasional time does arise when we must take one or more of the children out of the meeting. When we do, we’ve found it important to help the child to act as if he were seated inside the chapel—seated and quiet. Otherwise, going out of the meeting becomes a “reward” for misbehavior. We feel that threatening punishment would make our children dislike going to church, so we try to make separation from the rest of the family the alternative they’ll want to avoid.</para>
					<para paraID="10">When our children begin to stretch their capacity to stay in the meeting and to postpone coloring and playing with toys until after the sacrament, we as parents really try to make the service more meaningful for them. We do this in several ways.</para>
					<para paraID="11">We encourage even our littlest ones to participate actively in the singing. We share a song book—letting them hold it—and point to the words and notes as we go along. At home we sing the more familiar hymns, and teach a few special ones (“Come, Ye Children of the Lord” and “All Creatures of Our God and King” are among our favorites) so that when they are sung in church it will really be a special occasion for our children. Some parents even find out in advance the songs that are to be sung each Sunday, in order to prepare their family to participate.</para>
					<para paraID="12">Encouragement to participate in other “standard” parts of sacrament meeting, such as sustainings and releasings, and especially partaking of the sacrament itself, is also helpful. Some wards regularly incorporate a children’s story into the service, further enhancing children’s appreciation of the meeting.</para>
					<para paraID="13">Discussion of the speakers’ remarks after the meeting is good, but usually too late to meet the need. During the talks, then, we whisper in a child’s ear brief comments about the speaker’s topic. (Any other conversation is firmly refused.) This is where the scripture stories we’ve read to the children begin to tie into their lives, where they find elements of the worship service which are truly of value to them. This is also where they begin developing the capacity to wean themselves away from coloring books and other distractions.</para>
					<para paraID="14">In tailoring Sabbath activities for children it is important to remember the Savior’s love for them and his statement that we must become as a little child to inherit the kingdom of heaven. Did he see the childlike qualities of boundless energy, curiosity, and enthusiasm as characteristics merely to be tolerated, or as divine attributes to be nurtured? With <emphasis>his </emphasis>perspective in mind, we can use appropriate activity, goal-setting, and quality family time as keys to helping our children discover and share the joy of the Sabbath day.</para>

					<title paraID="1">My wife and I have become aware of a problem in our marriage: each of us is always trying to change the other. How can we resolve this conflict?</title>
				</titleBlock>
				<bodyBlock>
					<para paraID="2"><strong>Clark Swain, associate professor of marriage and family studies at Boise State University, Idaho, and marriage and family counselor</strong> Since successful marriage <emphasis>is</emphasis> a continual process of change and accommodation, you are not alone in coming up against some rough edges in your own adjustment. Ongoing changes in some areas are necessary for a good marriage. <emphasis>So change itself is not the problem—</emphasis>but admitting the need to change and helping one’s spouse make changes can be.</para>
					<para paraID="3">Let’s look at the issue of change in that light. Let me propose some questions that you can ask yourself:</para>
					<para paraID="4">1. Is this change that I’m getting messages about one that I <emphasis>should </emphasis>make? I think everyone will agree that it’s not much of a marriage if we’re not willing to make certain kinds of ongoing changes in ourselves, for the simple reason that we want to please our partners.</para>
					<para paraID="5">For example, one husband was bothered by what he considered to be too much talking on the phone. His wife interpreted his fidgeting when she was on the phone as a sign of displeasure. Instead of acting defensively, she kindly asked him about it. They both agreed to limit their evening calls to a few minutes, if possible, so they could spend more time together.</para>
					<para paraID="6">This wife’s action exemplifies good judgment in human relations. When we feel criticized, we tend to counterattack with a complaint of our own, or a statement of our “rights.” Instead, she asked herself what making the change would be worth to their relationship, and then she willingly made it as an act of love. One of the benefits was that her husband was more willing to make some of the changes that she desired.</para>
					<para paraID="7">2. How can I persuade my partner to make certain changes? Here’s how Eleanor, my wife, convinced me to change my attitude about typewriters:</para>
					<para paraID="8">When I was in graduate school, Eleanor thought that a standard typewriter would be more useful than the little portable we had. I was used to the small typewriter and resisted, but Eleanor had a standard model delivered to our house on a tryout basis and asked me to see how I liked it. I reluctantly yielded to the idea, but within a few days was using the standard more often because I liked it better. She used persuasion—not coercion or nagging—to get me to change.</para>
					<para paraID="9">Timing is important: if you want your husband or wife to make certain changes in attitude or behavior, be careful not to bring up the subject at mealtime or bedtime: tired, hungry people are often not receptive.</para>
					<para paraID="10">And there is another consideration: What is your motivation? Why should your spouse make the change? Is it really necessary? Is it a flaw in his or her behavior that needs to be improved? Or is it something that <emphasis>you </emphasis>should change <emphasis>your </emphasis>attitude about?</para>
					<para paraID="11">3. Can we improve our marriage by either compromising or kindly agreeing to disagree? A newlywed couple that I counseled made an easy adjustment about weekend entertainment. He liked to bowl; she preferred movies. Each, of course, wanted the company of the other for his or her favorite activity. Having a sense of fairness, they compromised by agreeing to go bowling one weekend and to the movies the next weekend.</para>
					<para paraID="12">Another solution where the husband and wife genuinely don’t share interests is for each person to concentrate on what he likes and leave the other space and permission to pursue his own interests. One older couple, after trying to compromise for years, discovered it worked much better to let the husband watch his football alone while the wife went to the symphony with a girlfriend. A sincere effort to share the other’s pleasure wasn’t enough to create a valid interest. And their solution certainly didn’t reduce their love for each other.</para>
					<para paraID="13">4. What circumstances can we change to improve our relationship? It must be recognized that as much as you may want a certain change, sometimes neither you nor your partner will be willing or perhaps able to make that change. In this case, you might try changing the circumstances. Eleanor decided that a firmer mattress would be better for her back, so we put a sheet of plywood over the box springs. Then I started waking up with backaches and wanted the plywood to go. Eleanor wanted it to remain. By cutting the board down the middle and removing half of it we changed the circumstances and thereby resolved our disagreement.</para>
					<para paraID="14">5. Will altering my attitude about the desired change improve our marriage? You may wish that your husband had more money or more hair, or that your wife were slimmer or had more education. But your partner cannot change some things and will not change others. Then it’s time to change your mind or attitude—not about your mate, but about what you think you have to have in a marriage partner in order to be happy.</para>
					<para paraID="15">In conclusion, husbands and wives in satisfying marriages realize that adjustment is a never-ending process. A successful marriage requires a continual effort to bring about positive changes in yourself, in your partner, in unwanted circumstances, and in your attitude.</para>

				</titleBlock>
				<bodyBlock>
					<para paraID="2"><strong>Grant E. Barton, manager of adult curriculum, Church Curriculum Planning and Development Division</strong> The Church-approved and produced lesson manual is a vital part of a teacher’s preparation. Each teacher should read and study the designated lesson. However, he will also find it useful to consult other approved sources, such as the <emphasis>Gospel Principles </emphasis>manual, the new scriptural helps (see October 1979 <emphasis>Ensign</emphasis>), and the general conference addresses, especially those of the living prophet.</para>
					<para paraID="3">A teacher who reads through these approved sources and prays to understand the needs of class members is entitled to inspiration so that he may teach by the Spirit. The Lord has counseled teachers to “treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="84" verse="85">D&amp;C 84:85</scriptureRef>). When teachers are “strong in the knowledge of the truth” and have “given themselves to much prayer, and fasting,” they will teach with the “power and authority of God” (<scriptureRef book="alma" chapter="17" verse="2-3">Alma 17:2–3</scriptureRef>).</para>
					<para paraID="4">A teacher is like a good cook. A cook takes basic foods and, using appropriate tools, prepares, seasons, and garnishes an appealing and nutritious meal; he then serves it with enthusiasm. Similarly, the teacher starts with basic eternal truths and, using the tools which the Lord has provided (the scriptures, Church resources, and prayer), he seasons and garnishes a lesson with an inspirational experience, a chart, a thought-provoking question, or a small-group experience. In short, he serves up an interesting and accurate spiritual feast, always accompanied by his fervent personal witness.</para>
					<para paraID="5">The Church-prepared manual provides the teacher with well-researched, correlated, and approved lessons for teaching the gospel to class members. But the teacher must provide the prayerful study, the testimony, the setting, the enthusiasm, and, often, an adaptation of explanations and illustrations. Through spiritual preparation, a teacher can speak “by the power of the Holy Ghost,” and eternal truths can be carried with renewed import “unto the hearts of the children of men” (<scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="33" verse="1">2 Ne. 33:1</scriptureRef>).</para>

			<kicker paraID="4">In the Book of Mormon, several specific episodes involve covenant-making. For example, Alma the Elder’s converts make covenants when they are baptized at the Waters of Mormon. The title page of the Book of Mormon states that one of its functions is to teach modern Israel to “know the covenants of the Lord.”</kicker>
		</titleBlock>
		<bodyBlock>
			<para paraID="5">Latter-day Saints feel strongly about being a covenant and covenant-making people. Part of Joseph Smith’s mission was that an “everlasting covenant might be established” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="1" verse="22">D&amp;C 1:22</scriptureRef>). Part of the Book of Mormon’s mission is to unite the covenant people of the Old World and covenant people of the New World through a covenant people of the latter days.<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker> Nephi says one reason his record quotes Isaiah at such length is to tell his readers about the covenants that are to be fulfilled in the last days (see <scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="6" verse="12-13">2 Ne. 6:12–13</scriptureRef>). Thus the “marvelous work” of the last days was specifically undertaken “that I [the Lord] may remember my covenants” and “recover my people” (<scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="29" verse="1">2 Ne. 29:1</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="6">The Book of Mormon is an inspired text that tells us about our covenant relationship to God and our responsibilities resulting from these covenants. Latter-day scriptures perform exactly the same function. In fact, covenant concepts are so important that <emphasis>covenants </emphasis>makes half the title of the Doctrine and Covenants. And since our modern covenants and covenant texts are so important, it is exciting to see the greater clarity and meaning they receive when we look at the function of covenants and covenant-making in ancient Israel.</para>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="7">Covenants in Ancient Israel</title>
				<para paraID="8"><emphasis>Yada. </emphasis>Ancient Israel claimed a divine relationship identified as a covenant between the people and God. This covenant relationship, making Israel separate from her neighbors, demanded that ancient Israelites have <emphasis>yada </emphasis>for their God, as he had for them. The Hebrew verb <emphasis>yada </emphasis>(or <emphasis>da’ath</emphasis>) is usually translated “to know” or “to be acquainted with.” But the covenant context adds both a mental and an emotional act. In Genesis 4:1, “Adam <emphasis>yada </emphasis>Eve” (King James: “Adam knew Eve his wife”); that is, in their covenant relationship they had mutual obligations and mutual concerns [<scriptureRef book="gen" chapter="4" verse="1">Gen. 4:1</scriptureRef>]. Adam acted out of concern, inner engagement, dedication, and affection for Eve. The relationship summed up as <emphasis>yada </emphasis>was more than just physical.</para>
				<para paraID="9">And the Old Testament is filled with examples. <emphasis>Yada </emphasis>describes the covenant relationship of mutual obligation and concern between God and Israel, his people.<noteMarker noteRef="2">2</noteMarker> The prophet Hosea clearly condemned Israel when he said: “My people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge [<emphasis>yada</emphasis>]” (<scriptureRef book="hosea" chapter="4" verse="6">Hosea 4:6</scriptureRef>). Hosea was not just suggesting that Israel had lost a knowledge of her God, but that they had ceased to identify with God’s causes and purposes. Israel had lost her ability to understand the great purposes the covenant relationship had been established to convey.</para>
				<para paraID="10"><emphasis>Covenants and treaties.</emphasis> The language of the Old Testament (mostly Hebrew) uses <emphasis>berith </emphasis>for both a civil treaty between political states and for the religious covenant between Israel and her God. Thus, studying the forms of ancient treaties has given Bible students insight into the form of ancient covenants as well. Following the studies of George Mendenhall, scholars have discovered that Hittite and Egyptian treaties follow a certain pattern.<noteMarker noteRef="3">3</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="11">An ancient treaty usually contained the following major parts: (1) The preamble. Since most of these treaties were between a king and a vassal (usually a group defeated in battle), the preamble spelled out the power relationship. Since the major power or conqueror spelled out this relationship, the preamble identified this personage and often gave his titles, attributes, and genealogy.</para>
				<para paraID="12">(2) The historical prologue. This section told the history of the two parties from the point of view of their new relationship, not to “rub in” the vassal’s weakness but to base their relationship on their history, not on force. Thus, this section attempted to create a sense of obligation on the vassal’s part. Here the sovereign recalled his great acts of protection and caring for the vassal in times past.</para>
				<para paraID="13">(3) The stipulations. This section spelled out the vassal’s essential obligations. The chief obligation was loyalty; that is, the vassal was to have no independent foreign connections or policy and no other sovereign or lords. As the chief threats to this loyalty would come in times of war and opposition (physical, economic, and moral), the vassal was forewarned to avoid these temptations. Most treaty stipulations contained either conditional clauses (“if … then”) or unconditional requirements (“thou shalt not”).</para>
				<para paraID="14">(4) Provisions for depositing the text and for public reading. This section required the contract’s public reading at regular intervals, usually at annual festivals or holy days. The text itself was to be placed in the central and sacred shrines of the vassal state. Often a special marker inscribed with the treaty was set up.</para>
				<para paraID="15">(5) Witnesses to the treaty. The god or gods of both the vassal and the major power were listed; nature could also be called upon (stones, rivers, mountains, valleys).</para>
				<para paraID="16">(6) Blessings and curses. This section recounted the blessings of protection, prosperity, and happiness the vassal would receive if he were loyal and true, and the curses if he were disloyal—usually a threat to totally destroy the offender and all he had.</para>
				<para paraID="17">(7) Ratification ceremonies. Ancient treaty-making ceremonies were usually climaxed or “sealed” by special ceremonies such as eating a meal together, sharing a drink from a common cup, using blood or salt symbolically or actually, giving the vassal a new name, or slaughtering an animal representing the vassal and cutting the carcass in pieces. Hence, <emphasis>karat berith </emphasis>or “to cut a treaty,” appears as a common phrase in ancient texts. The Old Testament reveals many parallels to treaty patterns. (See the basic structure of Deuteronomy, <scriptureRef book="josh" chapter="24">Josh. 24</scriptureRef> and <scriptureRef book="1-sam" chapter="12">1 Sam. 12</scriptureRef>.) Abraham cuts sacrifices apart, possibly a foreshadowing of circumcision as a ratification rite, and the Lord accuses Israel of transgressing a “covenant … made before me, when they cut the calf in twain” (see <scriptureRef book="gen" chapter="15" verse="7-12,17-18">Gen. 15:7–12, 17–18</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="jer" chapter="34" verse="17-19">Jer. 34:17–19</scriptureRef>). Other treaty/covenant elements found in the Old Testament include blood, salt, giving new names as part of covenant-making, and setting up stone pillars as witnesses of the covenant. (See <scriptureRef book="ex" chapter="24" verse="3-8">Ex. 24:3–8</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="lev" chapter="2" verse="13">Lev. 2:13</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="gen" chapter="17" verse="5">Gen. 17:5</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="gen" chapter="32" verse="27-28">Gen. 32:27–28</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="deut" chapter="28" verse="10">Deut. 28:10</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="gen" chapter="31" verse="44-45">Gen. 31:44–45</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="josh" chapter="24" verse="27">Josh. 24:27</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="deut" chapter="27" verse="2-3">Deut. 27:2–3</scriptureRef>.) In all of this these people used the treaty language, structure, and concepts to express their relationship to God.</para>
				<para paraID="18"><emphasis>The covenant lawsuit. </emphasis>Understanding Old Testament covenants as forms of treaties illuminates much of the prophetic literature. The prophets warn the people of the curses their disobedience will bring because they have violated the terms of the covenant. Some students of the Bible have suggested that the prophets are the Lord’s covenant “lawyers” who call Israel to account in a covenant lawsuit (<emphasis>rib</emphasis>), which has its own formal structure and occurs frequently enough in the Old Testament to reaffirm the covenant relationship’s importance throughout Israel’s history.<noteMarker noteRef="4">4</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="19"><emphasis>Functions of the covenant. </emphasis>From the beginning of the earth’s history, covenants have united individuals to God and to each other. From Abraham’s time, divinely revealed covenants united a family, then diverse tribes, and finally a nation, providing channels so that individuals could <emphasis>yada </emphasis>their true God, thus learning <emphasis>who </emphasis>and <emphasis>whose </emphasis>they were.</para>
				<para paraID="20">By entering into covenant relationships, we may give our loyalty to someone greater than ourselves and prove ourselves through our subsequent choices. Covenant relationships thus open new possibilities and relationships. Covenant-making ceremonies in ancient Israel dramatically brought the congregation to a point where they had to choose between one of two ways, thereby making decision and commitment and pledging loyalty. After this ceremony, there could be no excuse for disloyalty. (See <scriptureRef book="deut" chapter="30" verse="15-20">Deut. 30:15–20</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="1-kgs" chapter="18" verse="21">1 Kgs. 18:21</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="josh" chapter="24" verse="14-15">Josh. 24:14–15</scriptureRef>.) This positive commitment gave Israel an inner strength and vitality that, barring apostasy, could have sustained her throughout time.</para>

				<title paraID="21">Covenants in the New Testament</title>
				<para paraID="22">The New Testament explains the new covenant made possible by the life, death, and resurrection of Christ within the framework of the old. In the New Testament, the Greek word for covenant is <emphasis>diatheke </emphasis>and conveys the same meaning as <emphasis>berith. </emphasis>The Last Supper and the establishment of the sacrament became the symbols of the new covenant; but the form, structure, and function of ancient covenants remain intact. Clearly the sacrament is a ceremony that renews oaths of loyalty, obligation, and concern. It reviews commitments, involves eating and drinking together, and is a time of “cutting” (literally “breaking”) bread. It is a time to <emphasis>yada </emphasis>our God, a relationship made possible by the loving sacrifice of the Savior.</para>

				<title paraID="23">Covenants in Modern Israel</title>
				<para paraID="24"><emphasis>Covenants in the Book of Mormon. </emphasis>I have been impressed that the Lord told Joseph Smith in the First Vision that the restoration was needed because men’s hearts were “far from me” (<scriptureRef book="js-h" chapter="1" verse="19">JS—H 1:19</scriptureRef>). In other words, the world lacked <emphasis>yada </emphasis>and one of Joseph Smith’s main responsibilities would be to again make it possible for man to know God through covenant relationships. The Prophet’s first assignment was to translate an ancient covenant text, the Book of Mormon, which proclaims on its title page that one of its major functions is to teach modern Israel to “know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever.” Nephi quotes Isaiah because “my soul delighteth in the covenants of the Lord” (<scriptureRef book="2-ne" chapter="11" verse="5">2 Ne. 11:5</scriptureRef>). He and other prophets remind their people that they are of the house of Israel, that they reside in a land given them by covenant, and that they are under obligation to keep the covenant or be cursed.</para>
				<para paraID="25">Several specific episodes involve covenant-making. Alma the Elder’s converts make covenants when they are baptized at the Waters of Mormon (see <scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="18">Mosiah 18</scriptureRef>); General Moroni puts his army under covenant to protect their freedoms as “a remnant of the seed of Jacob [Israel]” (see <scriptureRef book="alma" chapter="46" verse="22">Alma 46:22</scriptureRef>); the resurrected Lord explains how the old covenants in the Law of Moses have been replaced by his new covenants (see <scriptureRef book="3-ne" chapter="12">3 Ne. 12</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="3-ne" chapter="15">3 Ne. 15</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="26">King Benjamin’s speech to his people and their pledge to be obedient to the Lord sounds very like many of ancient Israel’s holy days, when covenant texts were read to the congregation, who responded by making or renewing covenants (see <scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="3">Mosiah 3–6</scriptureRef>). Both religiously and politically, the people were drawn closer together by such ceremonies.<noteMarker noteRef="5">5</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="27">And as Moroni closes the Nephi record, in Isaiah’s words he challenges us, the Gentile readers of the last day, to “awake, and arise from the dust … that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled” (<scriptureRef book="moro" chapter="10" verse="31">Moro. 10:31</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="28"><emphasis>Covenants in the Doctrine and Covenants. </emphasis>This volume of modern scripture was printed with the title we know it by in 1835, its very name suggesting the importance of covenants. The first section, known as the Lord’s preface and addressed to those who will read the whole volume, tells us that he spoke to Joseph Smith so “that mine everlasting covenant might be established.” He explained that this covenant was necessary before that “which was written by the prophets” could be fulfilled (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="1" verse="18,22">D&amp;C 1:18, 22</scriptureRef>). In some important ways, then, this first section fulfills the function of preamble and historical prologue of a treaty-covenant in ancient Israel.</para>
				<para paraID="29">In the sections that follow, the words <emphasis>covenant </emphasis>or <emphasis>covenants </emphasis>appear over seventy-five times. An important place is the sacramental prayers, brief covenants meant to be repeated as the “church meet[s] together often” in worship settings (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="20" verse="75">D&amp;C 20:75</scriptureRef>). As the Lord restores the oath and covenant of the priesthood, he repeats how this priesthood was transmitted from Adam through the patriarchs to Moses and Aaron and then affirms that “the Father teacheth him [every man who is obedient to the Spirit] of the covenant which he has renewed and confirmed upon you” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="84" verse="48">D&amp;C 84:48</scriptureRef>). The revelations throughout the Doctrine and Covenants teach that one of the major functions of the priesthood is to administer covenant ceremonies so that all of God’s children who will hearken to the restored gospel can have a covenant relationship with their Savior and Father.</para>
				<para paraID="30">Accountability has always been a key factor in covenant-making, and as we have seen, is an important part of the ancient treaty-covenants. The Doctrine and Covenants not only specifies the age of eight as the precise age at which one becomes accountable, but it consistently instructs those under covenant that “every steward” must “render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="68" verse="25-28">D&amp;C 68:25–28</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="72" verse="3">D&amp;C 72:3</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="31">The Doctrine and Covenants also records the new and everlasting covenant of marriage, explains the role of the Holy Spirit in ratifying covenants, and reminds us that part of abiding “in my covenant, even unto death” is to turn “the hearts of the Jews unto the prophets, and the prophets unto the Jews” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="131" verse="1-4">D&amp;C 131:1–4</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="132" verse="7">D&amp;C 132:7</scriptureRef>; <scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="98" verse="14-17">D&amp;C 98:14–17</scriptureRef>).</para>
				<para paraID="32"><emphasis>Covenants and the individual. </emphasis>Our moral and ethical commitments are intensely personal. Naturally we would expect these kinds of covenants to find expression in our most sacred acts of worship—the ceremonies of the sacrament and the temple. In both cases, covenant-making ceremonies function as they did in ancient Israel. In the sacrament service, the actual content of the covenant (baptism) is assumed and the sacrament itself is a renewal ceremony.</para>
				<para paraID="33">Obviously, the act of partaking of the broken bread and water fulfill the requirements of a covenant ratification. And the bread, broken as part of the service, equally obviously suggests the “cutting” or dismembering of the sacrificial animal that is also part of the treaty-covenant ceremony.</para>
				<para paraID="34">While the content of the temple covenants is sacred knowledge reserved for the covenant-makers, those covenants are clearly linked with the covenants of ancient Israel in both their subjects and their form. Some of the more obvious elements are the sacred space in which the Saints worship, the covenant acts, and the deposit of covenant texts within the temple. Like ancient Israel, modern Israel comes to make these covenants in groups, and the commitments thus made turn the individual towards a life of service and love in the larger group. Just as the temples are “central places” in many of the communities where they are constructed, the covenants made there are central places in our individual and group spiritual lives. By providing a common standard and common goals, these covenants have the potential to make modern Israel of “one heart and with one mind” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="45" verse="65">D&amp;C 45:65</scriptureRef>).</para>

				<title paraID="35">How Covenants Teach</title>
				<para paraID="36">Modern covenants, like ancient ones, remind us of God’s love. They provide a relationship based on something besides force and power. They provide us the opportunity to <emphasis>yada </emphasis>our God through the life of Jesus Christ. That is why the free and loving gift of the Savior’s atonement lies at the heart of our covenant relationship.</para>
				<para paraID="37">But there are other important lessons to be learned by covenant making. The giving and taking of new names is part of covenant making, as we have seen. King Benjamin gave his people a “name that shall never be blotted out, except it be through transgression” (<scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="1" verse="12">Mosiah 1:12</scriptureRef>). As part of the sacrament ritual we take upon us the name of Christ and our temple worship also follows this pattern. Names not only symbolize new relationships between the givers and receivers, but provide new examples for us to emulate.</para>
				<para paraID="38">In short, covenants are channels through which we can all assume a new identity and a new relationship to our Lord. Every person born into the world is a child of God. By making covenants, we can become the sons and daughters of Christ, a conscious and purposeful separation from the fallen world around us, a transition from being a natural person to being a spiritual person, and an incorporation into the community of the righteous.</para>
				<para paraID="39">On one level, covenants are the mortar in the household of God, pulling the Saints together by giving us common goals and uniting us in common fellowship with both the living and the dead. Covenant relationships have been an essential part, not only of our religious history, but of our economic and political history as well, in this last dispensation. Without understanding the centrality of covenant making, it may well be impossible to understand Latter-day Saint history.</para>
				<para paraID="40">But on a more intimate level, covenants are the core of our personal development. Elder John A. Widtsoe of the Quorum of the Twelve suggested years ago that a covenant was “a promise to give life to knowledge.”<noteMarker noteRef="6">6</noteMarker> Thus the essential function of a covenant is to give us new knowledge of God and to establish a relationship with him that will let us enjoy a fullness of joy and blessings.</para>
				<para paraID="41">Covenants relate us to the universe, calling us to repentance by reminding us of our eternal potential and eternal obligations. They provide comfort and security in a painful world of doubt and suffering. They bind us to meet the needs of others through love, service, obedience, and loyalty—and insure that our own needs will be met in the same community.</para>
				<para paraID="42">But above all, covenants give us someone to emulate, for by focusing our attentions and our intentions on Christ, covenants draw us to him in righteousness. As righteous individuals, families, and communities, we can truly rejoice in the Lord’s words:</para>
				<para paraID="43">“Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine everlasting covenant, even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of men, that they might have life and be made partakers of the glories which are to be revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets and apostles in the days of old” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="66" verse="2">D&amp;C 66:2</scriptureRef>).</para>

			<para paraID="4">Repentance is not an incidental or casual thing: wise King Benjamin spoke to his people of “retaining a remission of your sins <emphasis>from day to day</emphasis>.” (<scriptureRef book="mosiah" chapter="4" verse="26">Mosiah 4:26</scriptureRef>; italics added.) I have long been impressed with the “day to day” aspect of being spiritually clean. It seems that, like many commonplace things in life, repentance and forgiveness need to occur in a regular pattern of daily orderliness.</para>
			<para paraID="5">The house we live in sits on a normal block in an average American community. Every blade of grass, every shrub, and every tree on the lot was planted by different members of the family during the years we’ve lived there. During that time, we’ve found through trial and error that the grass looks best when it’s mowed every fifth day. Cutting it after three days is a waste of energy; there’s not enough there to cut. If we wait eight or nine days, it’s too long and thatches into an ugly yellow layer. Yes, five days is just about right.</para>
			<para paraID="6">But some things can’t be done properly at five-day intervals.</para>
			<para paraID="7">Recently, I’d just parked my car in downtown Lubbock, Texas, when a colleague came by, looked at it and said, “Just had it washed, huh?”</para>
			<para paraID="8">Said I, “As a matter of fact, it hasn’t been washed for several weeks.”</para>
			<para paraID="9">He looked at its glittering red surface and then, suspiciously, at me. But it was true.</para>
			<para paraID="10">A few days later, I drove into a service station and the attendant asked where I’d had it waxed. “The truth of the matter is,” I said, “it hasn’t been waxed since I bought it sixteen months ago.”</para>
			<para paraID="11">“You don’t say,” he muttered, somewhat confused.</para>
			<para paraID="12">My car <emphasis>does </emphasis>shine, but not because I wash or wax it frequently. Instead, I take a few minutes and go over it with a damp chamois <emphasis>every </emphasis>morning. Because it’s clean, the paint doesn’t oxidize so fast and it’s actually shinier than it was when I bought it. The right time for preserving paint jobs on cars seems to be every day.</para>
			<para paraID="13">Now, what is the “right” time for repentance? Fortunately, we don’t have to experiment to discover the answer. The Lord has revealed through King Benjamin—and other prophets as well—that the right time to be spiritually concerned about our sins is every day. Once a week is not enough. Once a month or once a year could prove spiritually fatal. (Of course, repeated repentance of the same sin is not repentance at all.)</para>
			<para paraID="14">An essential aspect of true repentance is daily prayer. And it must be meaningful as well as regular. No man genuinely repents if he nonchalantly asks his Father to overlook his shortcomings just before he heads out the door to work. The right way to repent of sins is by going before our Maker in secret prayer, identifying the specific transgression, confessing it, forsaking it, and continuing in the Lord’s Spirit. As the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph: “I will forgive you of your sins with this commandment—that you remain steadfast in your minds in solemnity and the spirit of prayer.” (<scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="84" verse="61">D&amp;C 84:61</scriptureRef>.)</para>
			<para paraID="15">When our oldest boy went away to school, we instructed him to write home every week and to call at specified intervals. His doing so made the relationship between us even closer and more secure. When he needed to call on us in emergencies, we were happy and grateful to respond. In much the same way, I imagine, our Heavenly Father appreciates regular communication from us.</para>
			<para paraID="16">A few years ago my father needed to drive to Chihuahua City, Mexico, with some other businessmen, none of them members of the Church. When the business had been completed and they were packing the car to return, my father said that he had “forgotten some things upstairs” and went back to the bedroom for his daily prayers. One item of that prayer was a plea for protection on the return journey. His prayer was answered. Their car was involved in a terrible accident that killed the man next to my father instantly and injured the other men critically. My father was barely scratched, and to his expression of grief for the death of his associates was added a great outpouring of gratitude to our Heavenly Father for that protection in answer to his prayers, those daily prayers.</para>
			<para paraID="17">Yes, five days may be right for mowing the lawn, but repentance in the “spirit of prayer” works best when, it happens every day.</para>

			<subtitle paraID="2">Some Suggestions for Family Discussions</subtitle>
		</titleBlock>
		<bodyBlock>
			<para paraID="3">“Home evenings on Monday nights go pretty well in our family—the manual gives us the base we need to work from. But sometimes trying to get a good discussion going during family home evening or other family study periods is like pulling teeth.”</para>
			<para paraID="4">“It’s easy for our family to have fun together. But when it comes to discussing the gospel, suddenly everybody seems to forget how to talk.”</para>
			<para paraID="5">Sound familiar?</para>
			<para paraID="6">One of the benefits of the consolidated meeting schedule is more family time on Sunday, and families are encouraged to use some of this extra time studying the gospel together—in addition to regular family home evenings on Monday nights. But since there aren’t enough lessons in the home evening manual for all of these extra discussions, where can families turn for material?</para>
			<para paraID="7">The scriptures, of course, should be a primary source. And Church magazines—the <emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> <emphasis>New Era,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Friend</emphasis>—can also become a favorite resource for discussions. Many of the articles in the <emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> for example, could easily be adapted for discussion: messages from the First Presidency; conference talks and other current speeches; articles on marriage, family, needs of individuals, current Church curriculum, Church programs, how the gospel intersects with daily living, inspiring experiences of present-day Saints, and more.</para>
			<para paraID="8">To make your job easier, the <emphasis>Ensign</emphasis> begins this month to include some sample discussion questions for selected articles each month (see pp. 10, 16, and 48, this issue). After reading these articles individually or as a family, try discussing them and talking about some of the questions. Or try making up your own. With older children, avoid simple yes/no and recall questions—ask, instead, questions that require thought and analysis. A discussion can be a time when family members openly talk about a specific challenge or topic. Together, family members can give and seek information and opinions, ask questions, elaborate on ideas, make suggestions, and sometimes reach mutual conclusions.</para>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="9">Leading a Discussion</title>
				<para paraID="10">But how do you get started? What kinds of things do you keep in mind as you fill the role of discussion leader? The following nine points (adapted from <emphasis>How to Lead a Discussion: Some Practical Suggestions for Discussion Leaders, </emphasis>prepared by the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA for the 1973 June Conference) could come in handy as you attempt to lead family discussions:</para>
				<para paraID="11">1. Establish a good discussion climate. Each person should feel free to contribute, to share his ideas, to think aloud with the group—without fear of ridicule. Help family members realize that it’s good that everybody doesn’t think exactly alike, and that individual points of view are important. An opening hymn and prayer and comfortable seating (preferably in a circle) can help. Don’t insist on raising hands or taking turns. Keep the atmosphere free and informal.</para>
				<para paraID="12">2. Start out creatively. If you are discussing a scripture or an article or speech from the <emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> you may wish to read the material aloud together, or you might assign family members to read it individually first. Try other ways of getting the discussion going, too—analogies, stories, interesting questions, examples from the article, games, quizzes, or resources from the ward meetinghouse library (such as films, tapes, maps, pictures). Make sure that your attention-getter leads right into the discussion topic, and that the family understands clearly what the purpose of the discussion is. Be careful not to let the introduction take up all of your time.</para>
				<para paraID="13">3. After reading or reviewing the article you’ll discuss, move on to specific ways the material can apply to your family. For example, you might want to talk about a central character in the article: What did he do? What did he gain from his experience? How did his attitude change? What would you have done in his place? Would you have responded the same way?</para>
				<para paraID="14">Or you might discuss a situation in the article: Why did the events happen as they did? What other solutions might have been available? What can we do to cause—or avoid—this same situation in our family?</para>
				<para paraID="15">Or you might discuss your family’s reaction to the article: How did this article make you feel? What difference can it make in our own lives or in our family? What can we learn from this article?</para>
				<para paraID="16">Or try discussing an idea from the article: Do you agree with this author’s explanation of faith? How would <emphasis>you </emphasis>define it? What personal experiences have led you to feel this way?</para>
				<para paraID="17">As discussion leader, you don’t need to come up with all of the questions. Ask other family members to ask their own. Encourage them to make comments concerning their feelings about the article or the discussion.</para>
				<para paraID="18">4. Keep the discussion focused. It’s your job to kindly, yet firmly, keep the group from wandering too far from the topic. However, don’t worry if family members don’t say everything just like you would say it yourself, or if the discussion takes a different route than you had envisioned. Let others approach the subject in their own way.</para>
				<para paraID="19">5. Listen attentively to every comment. Try to understand the meaning behind every comment as well—and encourage others to do the same. In this way, family members—especially younger children—will recognize that what they are saying really matters, and they will feel more like sharing their ideas.</para>
				<para paraID="20">6. Encourage everybody to participate. Avoid letting one or two monopolize the discussion. Be sensitive to feelings of some family members who may feel intimidated by the comments or personalities of more vocal ones, and encourage them to voice their own points of view. Give everyone a chance to say something. Praise comments, when appropriate.</para>
				<para paraID="21">7. Avoid playing too dominant a role yourself. Don’t feel that you have to be the one to answer every question or add to every comment. Direct questions back to the family group or ask others for their ideas, comments, or solutions. Usually the more the discussion leader becomes a member of the group, the more others will participate.</para>
				<para paraID="22">8. Wrap up the discussion at the end. Summarize—or ask a family member to do it. Don’t simply repeat everything that was said; try to analyze the content. Ask the family if the summary has fairly represented their ideas.</para>
				<para paraID="23">9. Evaluate the discussion. Ask yourself or the family if all felt free to participate, and how to improve the next discussion.</para>

				<title paraID="24">Participating in a Discussion</title>
				<para paraID="25">Here are some suggestions for participants:</para>
				<para paraID="26">(1) Accept the responsibility to share your ideas, to answer questions. (2) Ask clarifying questions; if you’re lost, others probably are, too. (3) Don’t try to fill up all the silent spaces between comments. (4) Listen attentively to others instead of thinking only about what you are planning to say next. (5) Address your comments to the whole family, not just to the discussion leader or another person. (6) Don’t take up all the time with too many lengthy comments. (7) Allow others to have their own points of view, even if they differ from your own. Avoid contention; stay calm. If you feel you must disagree, be sensitive, kind, and friendly. (8) Help the family reach appropriate conclusions at the end of the discussion.</para>
				<para paraID="27">Most importantly, all family members should keep in mind that the purposes of the discussion are to draw closer as a family, to learn more about the gospel, to help strengthen faith and commitment—and to keep the lines of family communication open.</para>

			<para paraID="3">For a long time I had been harboring feelings of resentment toward some of my relatives, without understanding why. Then one morning as I lay quietly in bed, the answer came. I wanted to reject it, but I knew the still, small voice had truly spoken, and I have now begun to examine my attitudes in a new perspective. This enlightenment is changing my life!</para>
			<para paraID="4">The dilemma began five years ago when I attended a family gathering at wealthy cousin Angela’s home. Our Aunt Maud—the one who never married but who had been a blessing to everyone—had died, and this was an occasion to honor her and to be with other family members.</para>
			<para paraID="5">We grew up next door to Angela’s family, but we were always the poor relations. It seemed that their house and yard and children were better kept, more artistic, more cultured than ours. Angela’s mother—Aunt Angie—was a manager, and her children were “cleaned up” every evening for their father’s homecoming. I always crossed their threshold with fascination, but with fear, for I was seldom “cleaned up” and I never felt beautiful. Uncle Gregory was a reader, an artist, and a horticulturist; he was like the lord of the manor. His children had the finest music teachers, ponies, and a tennis court. My father, Uncle Gregory’s younger brother, was a cattleman, and a very resourceful one, but he died before his dreams could be realized.</para>
			<para paraID="6">As I tried to primp, wanting to look my best for the special family gathering, I remembered a day years earlier when Aunt Maud, noticing that I had no social life outside the home and that I needed to make friends, had paid me a special visit. I was about to leave for school and she gave me two choice bits of advice to take with me: first, lie down and rest a little every day, and second, remember that everyone in the world is lonely. That advice, coming from one who had known great loneliness, tugged at my heartstrings; I believe it was Aunt Maud who awakened me to the fact that other people might like to get acquainted with me.</para>
			<para paraID="7">Now, at thirty-nine, I had been married many years and had had several children. I needed time to restore my figure, and I needed money for a manicure and a hairdo. I had neither, but I had a dress that wasn’t bad, and this was one event even I wouldn’t miss for anything. As I reflected on Aunt Maud, I realized she had had the very personality trait I needed most—the ability to feel at ease in any company.</para>
			<para paraID="8">As I was graciously welcomed into Angela’s elegant home that evening, I knew that after going to school, earning a living, and being a wife and mother, I should now feel comfortable in this adult group. Instead, the old self-consciousness, misgivings, and fear returned. I was awed by the white-bannistered staircase, the enormous living room with velvet drapes and deep carpets, the chandeliers, and the grand piano; I wondered if anyone noticed how awkward and self-conscious I felt. I told myself I didn’t need to make conversation, yet I tried once or twice, and afterward felt foolish. When it was time to leave, and I should have thanked Angela for the opportunity she had given us all to meet in her beautiful home, the only words that came to my lips were, “What a pity you never had children of your own.”</para>
			<para paraID="9">Why should I have reminded her of that, the great disappointment of her life? Was I priding myself on the only thing I had that she didn’t have? I cursed my lowly tongue.</para>
			<para paraID="10">Cousin Nan and her husband drove me home, and I hoped that in the dark they wouldn’t notice how shabby our house was. As I stepped from the car, I slipped in a mud puddle and wrenched my ankle. They showed great concern, but I told them it was nothing and hurried painfully away.</para>
			<para paraID="11">I tiptoed through the house, thankful my family was sleeping, and paused in the bathroom to look at my straggly hair, shiny nose, and pained expression. Suddenly the whole situation seemed hopeless, and I sobbed uncontrollably. I didn’t know why, but it seemed so good to cry. Perhaps the concern and sympathy of relatives made me feel pitied. But I also knew it went deeper than that.</para>
			<para paraID="12">For the next five years I tried to understand that experience. Perhaps I was moving closer and closer to genuine self-knowledge all the time. Finally, as I lay in bed that morning, the Spirit spoke and I heard words I didn’t want to hear: “You’re jealous.”</para>
			<para paraID="13">At first I resisted the thought. How could I be jealous of the people I had criticized? How could one who thought jealousy was wrong be jealous? But even as I protested, I knew it was true. And perhaps the truth would at last free me of my bad feelings.</para>
			<para paraID="14">I now realized it was I who had to make amends. Realizing that I really wouldn’t change places with anyone has done much to free me from my uncomfortable feelings about my status. I have been able to relinquish my desires to outdo my cousins and can see some justification for their reactions to their shabby, ill-at-ease relatives. They were brought up with certain values and as the scripture says, “Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the Lord pondereth the heart.” (<scriptureRef book="prov" chapter="21" verse="2">Prov. 21:2</scriptureRef>)</para>
			<para paraID="15">I look forward to meeting them again. This time I will not worry about myself. There is much I can praise or thank them for—their kindness and graciousness, the beauty and refinement they create around them. Now that my jealousy is slinking away, I can begin to love them.</para>

					<para paraID="3">It would be impossible to describe the feelings I had when late one evening a police officer came to our door to tell my daughter and me that my husband had been killed in a one-car accident. He had left just an hour before to drive to his parents’ home, some thirty miles away. The shock seemed impossible to bear. Our loving bishop helped greatly, and the beautiful funeral and inspired talks added strength.</para>
					<para paraID="4">The day after the funeral I went to my bedroom to rest. I was still greatly moved in my feelings. For the first time I noticed my husband’s triple combination lying open on the night stand. I remembered seeing him read from it often prior to his death. I picked it up to see what he had been reading. It was open to the last verses of Enos, and I read:</para>

					<para paraID="3">I was working the night shift at the hospital when I first heard about the gospel. Some of the workers began discussing religion one night, and of course each one thought his church was true, although each believed in different doctrines. I knew they couldn’t all be right, but I said I didn’t think it mattered which church you belonged to, as long as you believed in God and Christ.</para>
					<para paraID="4">I had been active in a Protestant faith for fifteen years and tried to live all the teachings of the Bible as I understood them. One day our minister said that God did not reveal himself through prophets anymore, but only through scripture. When he said that, the Spirit spoke to me so loudly that it almost seemed as if others could hear it too and said, “That’s not true.” I didn’t know what that meant, so I didn’t mention it to anyone.</para>
					<para paraID="5">Then, in our hospital conversation, one brave nurse dared to say that the Mormon Church was true because it had a prophet at the head to guide it. “A prophet in this day and age?” I thought disdainfully, and I let her know I didn’t believe it.</para>
					<para paraID="6">“I can prove it,” she said. And she brought me a book to read—the Book of Mormon. I was amazed at what I read, and as I continued I felt a burning in my bosom just as I had when I read the Bible. When I read Moroni’s exhortation to ask God the Eternal Father if the book was true, I decided I would do just that. I never really thought that the Lord cared enough about me to let me know. I just asked because I believed in God and Jesus.</para>
					<para paraID="7">That night in a dream the Bible and the golden plates were brought before my face. The plates were shining so bright they were like the sun. I began to understand in my dream that both were true, but that the plates were more true and more pure. When I awoke it was with a testimony. Then the nurse gave me the Doctrine and Covenants to read, and when I had finished it, I knew I wanted to be a member of the church that had received so many truths in this dispensation.</para>
					<para paraID="8">I attended a Latter-day Saint service, not knowing how I would be received as a black woman in a church that was, for all I knew, all white. I went only because I knew it was true. But everyone was very friendly, warm, and loving.</para>
					<para paraID="9">I took the six missionary discussions from two lovely lady missionaries, but then my husband wouldn’t let me be baptized because he couldn’t understand the changes in my life. Now I was torn inside, knowing where Christ’s true church was, and not being able to join it. About eight months later I decided I would not attend my former church anymore. I would fast and pray and contribute to the Latter-day Saint church, even if I was never baptized.</para>
					<para paraID="10">After about a year, on a fast Sunday, my husband told me he would approve my baptism. That day and the day of my baptism were two of the happiest days of my life. I’ll always be grateful for the nurse who gave me a Book of Mormon. She started me on the path to eternal life, and I know that if I am faithful and endure to the end, I will have a place in His kingdom.</para>

					<para paraID="3">The Speaker’s hand automatically found the “on” switch for the microphone while he scanned the bills on the day’s calendar. He glanced up from his papers to find me. I nodded an okay. The gavel came down three times.</para>
					<para paraID="4">“The House will come to order. The Clerk will call the roll.”</para>
					<para paraID="5">“Adams, Amen, Anderson, Backstrom, Bagnariol.<nb/>…” The members of the state House formed automatically on my tongue. My pencil ticked behind the names of those who responded and left untouched those who did not.</para>
					<para paraID="6">Five legislative sessions had etched the names and faces into my mind. Only election years and emergencies brought changes. I was beginning to feel like one of the omnipresent machines that helped oil the legislative process. I scanned the chambers and picked up four legislators who had come on the floor late. I quickly tabulated, then announced the roll. “Mr. Speaker, ninety-four present, five absent or excused.”</para>
					<para paraID="7">The Speaker rose, announced the flag bearers’ names, and rapped the gavel. Ninety-four chairs sighed as ninety-four legislators stood to honor the flags of country and state. All heads turned as the flags were carried with slow strides down the broad center aisle that separated the political parties. The bearers ascended the stairs and crossed to the back of the large Speaker’s podium. The flag poles chinked into the standards and the guest minister arose in a rustle of black robes to offer the invocation. My mind wandered as the prayer began. “And why shouldn’t it?” I rationalized. “I’ve heard all of the carefully polished phrases and clever sayings I can stand in prayers.”</para>
					<para paraID="8">Suddenly something caught my ear; a ring of sincerity, a touch of spontaneity. I listened.</para>
					<para paraID="9">“Except the people repent, this land will be cursed with a sore curse! I pray that the people of this state and you, their legislators, will repent of their sins that this state may overcome its grave and serious problems. I exhort these things in Jesus’ name. Amen.”</para>
					<para paraID="10">A jolt of excitement ran through me. Then I did something I hadn’t done in five legislative sessions; I turned from the rostrum and strode to the minister, who was just starting to sit down. He straightened when he saw me approach. I shook his hand firmly.</para>
					<para paraID="11">“That’s the best prayer I’ve heard offered in these chambers. It’s nice to meet someone with the honesty and fortitude to say what really needs to be said.”</para>
					<para paraID="12">“Well, I appreciate your thanking me. I’m not too sure that my prayer was received with the same enthusiasm by the assembled body.”</para>
					<para paraID="13">One glance proved him to be right; several unveiled stares iced the spot where we were standing.</para>
					<para paraID="14">“Well, you really didn’t expect to tickle their ears, did you? Anyway, I’d like you to know that I appreciate your honesty.”</para>
					<para paraID="15">I started to turn back to the rostrum, but I could see he wanted to talk.</para>
					<para paraID="16">“You know,” he continued, “a few months ago I wouldn’t have given that prayer, but I have been so fired up by some of the lay members in my own church that it has made me come alive. Frankly,” he confided, “the church has become a dead horse. Even though we have many millions of members, the church has become lifeless. The only hope is the lay movement in the church.” The minister went on to say how enthusiastic he was about some of the laity in his church and how they were trying to breathe life back into it.</para>
					<para paraID="17">I excused myself to read in a senate bill. It was controversial so I knew the debate would be long. That would give me the time I needed.</para>
					<para paraID="18">When I returned, he continued in hopeful terms about the lay movement in his church. When he paused, I interjected, “You know, I have a feeling you would really be interested in the Mormon Church.”</para>
					<para paraID="19">“What makes you think that?” A hint of a frown came over his face.</para>
					<para paraID="20">“Well, the things you’re missing in your church—you can find them in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.”</para>
					<para paraID="21">While the floor debate droned on, I told him of my conversion to the Church, gave him a capsule version of the First Vision, and a brief outline of some of the Church programs. I sensed that the floor debate was nearing completion and that my time was limited. Our eyes met. His gaze did not waver and I told him that I knew that God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith, that the gospel in its fulness was now on the earth. As I bore my testimony, a warm glow kindled within me, and I knew it was emanating from me, for the minister’s eyes were still locked on mine. Without hesitation he reached out and shook my hand firmly.</para>
					<para paraID="22">“I believe what you have told me. I can sense the truth of it. Please send me all the material you can on your church.”</para>
					<para paraID="23">When the Speaker looked over to see if I was ready for the final vote, I quickly returned to the roll call machine to set up the bill and its number through a switching procedure. The gong signaling the start of the vote brought a scurry of movement as legislators who were not on the House floor for the final debate rushed back to flip their voting tab to yes or no. All eyes were on the big board as the lighted numbers rolled out to seal the fate of the bill.</para>
					<para paraID="24">“Has everyone voted? Does anyone want to change his or her vote? The Speaker will lock the roll call machine; the clerk will take the roll.” I pressed hard on the tabulator button. A triplicate sheet of the results slowly emerged from a thin slot in the machine.</para>
					<para paraID="25">The phrase “just a part of the machinery” came into my mind again as I went through the routine of setting up for the next vote. Just then someone touched my shoulder. The minister was standing beside me.</para>
					<para paraID="26">“I appreciate what you have shared with me. Be sure to send that information,” he said softly.</para>
					<para paraID="27">He turned and left the rostrum as the session continued. The warm feeling returned to my bosom and expanded to fill my whole body. I had been reminded of the joy of sharing testimony—and hoped I would remember that joy, for some time to come.</para>

			<para paraID="4">Brigham Young—organizer, pioneer, inspired prophet of God. We revere him as an energetic, fearless man of action who helped establish the kingdom of God on earth and helped ensure its nonstop proliferation through the best and worst of times.</para>
			<para paraID="5">Yet Brigham Young’s story is hardly one of auspicious beginnings or easy circumstances. And it is not the history of his life alone. Rather, his story commences with a family portrait. Father, mother, brothers, and sisters formed an intimate, cherished nucleus where Brigham was nourished in Christian principles and thereby prepared to embrace the restored gospel. All living members of his immediate family joined the Church, became stalwarts in the faith, and set spiritual precedents for future generations.<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker></para>
			<topic>
				<title paraID="6">Early Years</title>
				<para paraID="7">Brigham Young was the third youngest of eleven children born to John and Abigail (“Nabby”) Howe Young between 1786 and 1807. John, a veteran of three Revolutionary War campaigns under George Washington, married Nabby in 1785. The young couple settled on a farm in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. John, a “small, nimble, wiry man,”<noteMarker noteRef="2">2</noteMarker> toiled unceasingly to support his rapidly growing family. But he never lost sight of his moral and religious convictions. “He was very circumspect, exemplary and religious,” wrote Brigham, “and was, from an early period of his life, a member of the Methodist Church.”<noteMarker noteRef="3">3</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="8">Nabby was one of the five popular Howe sisters of Shrewsbury, near Hopkinton—“pretty girls, vivacious, musical. … All were very devout and deeply concerned with Puritan religious life.” Physically, Nabby was “a little above medium height. She had blue eyes, with yellowish brown hair, folded in natural waves and ringlets across her shapely brow.” And the nineteen-year-old was “exceedingly methodical and orderly in her temperament.”<noteMarker noteRef="4">4</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="9">She had innate medical ability, as her son Phinehas testified:</para>
				<para paraID="10">“My earliest recollection of the scenes of life are relating to myself and my brother Joseph. A short time before I was two years old, he cut off my right hand, except a small portion of my little finger, with an ax, while we were at play. My mother doctored it and saved it.”<noteMarker noteRef="5">5</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="11">The first eight Young children were Nancy, born in 1786; Fanny (1787); Rhoda (1789); John, Jr. (1791); Nabby, her mother’s namesake (1793); Susannah (1795); Joseph (1797); and Phinehas Howe (1799).</para>
				<para paraID="12">After sixteen years in Hopkinton (with a brief interlude in Platauva District, New York), John moved his family into a log cabin on the outskirts of Whitingham, Windham County, Vermont, in the bitter New England cold of January 1801. Here, five months later, Brigham was born on 1 June 1801. The family remained in Whitingham for about three years while John cleared timber to render the land suitable for farming.</para>
				<para paraID="13">Another promising land enterprise took the Youngs to Sherburn, Chenango County, New York, in 1804, where John “followed farming, clearing new land, and enduring many hardships, with his family, incidental to new settlements in a heavy timbered country as New York was in those days.”<noteMarker noteRef="6">6</noteMarker> Here the last two children were born, Louisa in 1804 and Lorenzo Dow in 1807.</para>
				<para paraID="14">Despite John’s industry, Nabby’s thrift, and occasional prospects for economic improvement, the Youngs never had material success. Sacrifice, illness, and poverty were constant, unremitting companions. Brigham reflected years later on the discrepancies between his father’s dreams and the disheartening reality:</para>
				<para paraID="15">“My father was a poor, honest, hard-working man; and his mind seemingly stretched from east to west, from north to south; and to the day of his death he wanted to command worlds” (<emphasis>Journal of Discourses, </emphasis>9:104).</para>
				<para paraID="16">By the time baby Lorenzo Dow joined the family in 1807, two of his sisters had already married and left home. Nancy married Daniel Kent in 1803; the same year Fanny, then sixteen, married Robert Carr.</para>
				<para paraID="17">Joseph Young recalled that when baby Brigham was a few months old, “my father bought a cow … and it is worthy of note that the cow gave more milk than any one I have ever seen since that time. … The animal would suffer no one to come near her, except my sister Fanny, who with the infant Brigham in her arms performed this service of milking twice each day during the summer; this was in consequence of the sickness of my mother, and the child had to be nursed from the bottle, and no one could pacify him but my sister Fanny.”<noteMarker noteRef="7">7</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="18">Daughter Nabby, then fourteen, died of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1807. The illness had ravaged the frail constitution of her mother for several years and would ultimately prove fatal to her, also. It was a prolonged, agonizing death, common among frontier families of the day.</para>
				<para paraID="19">In 1813 two more of John and Nabby’s children left the nest. In February Rhoda, then twenty-three, married John Pourtenous Greene; later that year John, Jr., married Theodocia Kimball. Susannah married James Little in 1814. By this time the family had moved again—to Cayuga County, New York.</para>
				<para paraID="20">When in June of 1815 Nabby Young finally lost the long and painful battle against consumption, five of her children—Joseph, Phinehas, Brigham, Louisa, and Lorenzo—ages just under eight to eighteen, were living at home. Fanny, separated from her unfaithful husband, had returned to the household during Nabby’s final days, and for a while kept the family together. Within three years of Nabby’s death, however, father and children had gone separate ways, though strong family ties still united them in many respects. Joseph had been apprenticed out to a brother-in-law, James Little (Susannah’s husband), for miscellaneous “service”; Lorenzo lived for a while with a sister, Rhoda Greene, and later joined the Littles to learn gardening and tree raising.</para>
				<para paraID="21">Phinehas married Clarissa Hamilton at age nineteen in 1818. Father Young meanwhile moved to Tyrone, New York, and in 1817 married Hannah Brown, a widow with several children. She and John would have a son, Edward. Brigham, apprenticed to a carpenter in Auburn (near Tyrone), in a short time became an expert carpenter, painter, and glazier. Louisa probably lived with her father and stepmother until she married Joel Sanford in 1825.</para>

				<title paraID="23">The Youngs and the Gospel</title>
				<para paraID="24">Religious commitment had always been a strong force in John Young’s family. It is interesting to note that as the gospel restoration approached, a remarkable series of events began to transpire in the lives and hearts of the Youngs. John and Nabby Young’s children had been taught principles of Christian living. Methodist circuit riders were welcomed with attentiveness and respect. Even such unorthodox preachers as Lorenzo Dow, after whom the youngest Young was named, evoked the interest of most of the family. Several Young brothers recorded early spiritual experiences.</para>
				<para paraID="25">Brigham later recalled his brother Joseph’s religious commitment: “In early life he became attached to religion, and was very moral and devoted. … He was a Methodist preacher for many years.”<noteMarker noteRef="8">8</noteMarker> Joseph, Brigham noted, was also the most serious-minded of men: “My brother Joseph once said to me (and we were both Methodists at the time), ‘Brother Brigham, there is not a Bible Christian in the world; what will become of the people?’ For many years no person saw a smile on his [Joseph’s] countenance, in consequence of the burden of the Lord being upon him, and realizing that the inhabitants of the earth had all gone out of the way and had turned every man to his own views” (<emphasis>Journal of Discourses, </emphasis>12:95).</para>
				<figure figType="image">
					<image altText="Joseph Young" webURL="ensignlp.nfo:o:2e8e.jpg"/>

						<para paraID="26">Joseph Young</para>

				</figure>
				<para paraID="27">And Brigham placed considerable stock in his brother’s spirituality: “I knew that he was solemn and praying all the time. I had more confidence in his judgment and discretion, and in the manifestations of God to him, than I had in myself” (<emphasis>Journal of Discourses, </emphasis>8:37).</para>
				<para paraID="28">John, six years older than Joseph, joined the Methodist Church when he was fourteen or fifteen. For several years he was “devotedly attached to that religion.”<noteMarker noteRef="9">9</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="29">Phinehas, 2 1/2 years Brigham’s senior, was likewise reared in the Methodist faith, but struggled for many years to find spiritual identity. Shortly after his marriage in 1818 he tried to “get religion” but found no satisfaction. For the next few years he wavered between religious and worldly values:</para>
				<para paraID="30">“I sought for riches, but in vain; there was something that always kept telling me that happiness originated in higher pursuits, and in the fall of 1823, a few months previous to my twenty-fourth birthday, I again commenced seeking the Lord with greater energy and a more fixed determination than at any former period of my life.</para>
				<para paraID="31">“I forsook all my former associates, and commenced praying and fasting and watching every weakness of my nature, and the more I prayed, the more I saw my weakness and felt my dependence upon God.” He joined the Methodist Reformed Church, received “license to speak in public,” and “prayed continually to God to make me holy and give me power to do good.”</para>
				<para paraID="32">Once when Phinehas visited a young woman dying of consumption, he was prompted to “lay hands on the sufferer and rebuke the disease.” He did so, and the woman was healed. He wrote, “I had never seen anything of the kind in my life, but had always believed the people were living far beneath their privileges.”<noteMarker noteRef="10">10</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="33">It was perhaps the youngest son, Lorenzo, who saw earliest that he and members of his immediate family would play a significant part in the unfolding drama of God’s latter-day kingdom. In 1816, barely nine years old, he had a startlingly prophetic dream: “I thought I stood in an open space or ground and saw a good, well defined road leading, at an angle of forty-five degrees, into the air as far as I could see. I heard a noise similar to that of a carriage in rapid motion, at what seemed the upper end of the road. In a moment it came into sight, drawn by a pair of beautiful white horses. The carriage and harness appeared brilliant with gold, and the horses traveled with the speed of the wind. It was manifested to me that the Savior was in the carriage, and that it was driven by his servant. It stopped near me and the Savior inquired ‘Where is your brother Brigham?’ After answering his question he inquired about my other brothers, and concerning my father. His queries being answered satisfactorily, he stated that he wanted us all, but especially my brother Brigham. The team then [turned] about and returned the way it came. … Subsequent events proved that it foreshadowed our future. It was evidently fulfilled when my father and all of his family entered into the new and everlasting Covenant.”</para>
				<figure figType="image">
					<image altText="Lorenzo Young" webURL="ensignlp.nfo:o:2e90.jpg"/>
					<caption>
						<para paraID="34">Lorenzo Young</para>
					</caption>
				</figure>
				<para paraID="35">Lorenzo further recalled that his mother, “a praying, fervent woman” and an invalid until she died when he was seven, “frequently called me to her bedside and counseled me to be a good man that the Lord might bless my life.” He added, “On one occasion she told me that if I would not neglect to pray to my Heavenly Father, he would send a guardian angel to protect me in the dangers to which I might be exposed.”<noteMarker noteRef="11">11</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="36">His mother’s admonition and promise sustained Lorenzo through a lifelong series of illnesses and accidents. Lorenzo was convinced that “the guardian angel, promised him by his mother, watched over his spiritual as well as temporal welfare.”</para>
				<para paraID="37">Throughout Lorenzo’s strivings for spiritual enlightenment, “a spirit worked with him to do all the good he could but not to join any religious [denomination], and at this time it prevailed against all temptation. … ‘I think at the time … I had as much of the spirit of the Lord with me as I could well enjoy in my ignorance of the Gospel in its purity. I was full of the testimony of the truth as I understood it.’”<noteMarker noteRef="12">12</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="38">In the years following Nabby’s death and John’s remarriage, John and his new family moved to Mendon, Monroe County, New York. Nearly all of Father Young’s children, with their growing families, gathered to Mendon and nearby villages within several years. Most would soon hear and accept the restored gospel.</para>
				<para paraID="39">Phinehas, who moved to Mendon in spring 1828, described the religious activity of the area: “About this time my father, brother Lorenzo and others of my father’s family, moved into the town. We immediately opened a house for preaching, and commenced teaching the people according to the light we had; a reformation commenced, and we soon had a good society organized, and the Lord blessed our labors.<nb/>…</para>
				<para paraID="40">“Thus things moved on until the spring of 1830, and I might say until 1832; there was little or no change in the progress of the reformation; notwithstanding, I, as an individual, felt that we had arrived at the zenith of our enjoyment in the course we were pursuing.”<noteMarker noteRef="13">13</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="41">Meanwhile, April 1830 brought the formal organization of the restored Church of Jesus Christ—and the Prophet had lost little time in commencing missionary efforts. Samuel H. Smith was on the road by June, preaching and selling copies of the Book of Mormon.</para>
				<para paraID="42">On the second day of his journey, Smith called at the home of John P. and Rhoda Young Greene. Greene, a Methodist minister, expressed no interest in the book but in kindness took a few copies to sell them on an upcoming preaching tour. Samuel Smith left, promising to return in two weeks. Later, “more out of curiosity than desire, both Mr. Greene and his wife read the book and were deeply impressed. Samuel sold a copy to Phinehas Howe Young, and this copy was read by his brother Brigham Young. The copy left with John P. Greene and the one sold to Phinehas Howe Young brought the first direct information of the restoration of the gospel to the Young family.”</para>
				<figure figType="image">

						<para paraID="43">Phinehas Young</para>

				</figure>
				<para paraID="44">Phinehas, who apparently received a Book of Mormon from Samuel Smith a short time later, was impressed neither with the missionary nor the publication. Samuel declared that he knew the book “to be a revelation from God, translated by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, and that my brother Joseph Smith, Jun., is a Prophet, Seer and Revelator.” Phinehas recorded that “this language seemed to me very strange, and, I thought, rather ridiculous, still I said but little more to him, as I thought he must be deceived, and that the book was a production got up to lead the people astray; however, I thought it my duty to read it, as I had promised, and search out the errors, and as a teacher in Israel, expose such errors and save the people from the delusion.” His suspicions were soon overturned.</para>
				<para paraID="45">“I commenced and read every word in the book in the same week,” he recorded. “The week following I did the same, but to my surprise, I could not find the errors that I anticipated, but felt a conviction that the book was true.</para>
				<para paraID="46">“…<nb/>My father then took the book home with him, and read it through. I asked him his opinion of it. He said it was the greatest work and the clearest of error he had ever seen, the Bible not excepted.</para>
				<para paraID="47">“I then lent the book to my sister, Fanny Murray. She read it and declared it a revelation. Many others did the same.”</para>
				<para paraID="48">Believing in this new “Golden Bible” but still firm in Methodism, Phinehas left New York on a preaching mission with his brother Joseph in late August. Calling on an “old acquaintance by the name of Solomon Chamberlain” along the way, they heard an impromptu sermon on Mormonism. “He told us there was a Church organized, and ten or more were baptized, and everyone must believe the Book of Mormon or be lost. This was the first I had heard of the necessity of another church,” wrote Phinehas, “or of the importance of re-baptism; but after hearing the old gentleman’s arguments, … I began to inquire seriously into the matter, and soon became convinced that such an order of things was necessary for the salvation of the world.”</para>
				<para paraID="49">Able to think of “but little except the Book of Mormon and what I had heard of Mormonism,” Phinehas found his own preaching ineffective and determined to return to his home. “I still continued to preach,” he wrote, “trying to tie Mormonism to Methodistism [sic], for more than a year, when I found they had no connection and could not be united, and that I must leave the one and cleave to the other.</para>
				<para paraID="50">“About this time my brother Brigham came to see me, and very soon told me that he was convinced that there was something to Mormonism. I told him I had long been satisfied of that.”</para>

				<para paraID="52">Brigham was soon on his way to Canada “to tell the good tidings to our brother Joseph, who was there preaching Methodistism, and to try to get him to come home with him.”<noteMarker noteRef="14">14</noteMarker> By the end of April 1832 some of Mormonism’s most devoted followers had been baptized: Father Young and his wife Hannah; Brigham and Miriam Young; Phinehas H. and Clarissa Young; Joseph Young; Lorenzo D. and Persis Young; John P. and Rhoda Young Greene; and Fanny Young Murray. The remaining members of the Young family were not far behind. Susannah, widowed in 1822 and married to William Stilson in 1829, was baptized in June 1832; Louisa, married to Joel Sanford, also came into the fold that year. Nancy Young Kent and her husband, Daniel, joined the Church in 1833 in Tyrone, New York. And John, Jr., was baptized, after a thorough investigation of the Church and its tenets, in October of 1833.</para>
				<para paraID="53">John Young lived to partake of both the joys and sufferings of the Lord’s elect. He moved with his family to Kirtland in the fall of 1833. The next year he was ordained a patriarch by President Joseph Smith. Little is recorded of his persecutions, but the Prophet Joseph Smith recorded John Young’s October 1839 death by reflecting the difficulties of his final years: “He was … a firm believer in the everlasting Gospel of Jesus Christ; and fell asleep under the influence of that faith that buoyed up his soul, in the pangs of death, to a glorious hope of immortality; fully testifying to all, that the religion he enjoyed in life was able to support him in death. He was driven from Missouri with the Saints in the latter part of the last year. He died a martyr to the religion of Jesus, for his death was caused by his sufferings in the cruel persecution” (<emphasis>History of the Church, </emphasis>4:14–15).</para>

				<para paraID="55">Three of Brigham’s five living sisters—Nancy, Fanny, and Susannah—crossed the plains and lived to see the desert begin to blossom under the direction of their younger brother Brigham. Rhoda, weakened by inflammatory rheumatism and the hardships of fleeing mobs in Ohio and Missouri, died in Commerce, Illinois, in 1840 at age fifty-one. She had borne seven children to her husband, John P. Greene, “to whom,” recorded Brigham, “she was truly a helpmate through all the varied travels of life.”<noteMarker noteRef="15">15</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="56">Louisa apparently went with her husband, Joel Sanford, and their four children to Missouri in 1833 and died in Independence that year at the age of twenty-nine.</para>
				<para paraID="57">Nancy Young Kent, widowed in 1853, lived for a while with two of her children in Wisconsin. Franklin W. Young recorded that in 1857, “in company with her nephew, Wm. G. Young, she went with ox teams to Utah, where she lived in her bro. Brigham Young’s Lion House until the 22 Sept. 1860 when she died at the good old age of 74 years, honored and beloved by all who knew her.”<noteMarker noteRef="16">16</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="58">Susannah had borne eight children, been twice widowed, and “suffered many of the persecutions of the Church” by the time she crossed the plains in 1849. Sadly, she had little strength left to see her through the continuing hardships of life in Salt Lake City’s infancy; she died there in the spring of 1852 at age fifty-seven.</para>
				<para paraID="59">Fanny Young Murray left Nauvoo, Illinois, apparently alone, journeying with a pioneer company to Salt Lake City sometime between 1847 and 1849. Fanny was seventy-two when she died in 1859.</para>
				<para paraID="60">All four of Brigham’s brothers remained faithful and filled leadership positions in the councils of the Church—Joseph as a president of the original quorum of seventies; John, Jr., as stake patriarch; Phinehas as bishop and counselor in a stake presidency; Lorenzo as bishop and director of home missionaries (missionaries who labored in Utah and its environs). Each served several missions for the Church; each endured untold persecutions from mobs and politicians; each followed his prophet-brother across the country to settle in the Rocky Mountains.</para>
				<para paraID="61">Most of the brothers married several times; from the marriages of them and of their sisters came dozens of children—including many faithful Saints who would build and strengthen the Church for generations. Though it would be virtually impossible to catalogue the descendants of each of these noble Saints, it is important to acknowledge their vital contributions to the establishment and growth of the Church.</para>

				<para paraID="63">The Young brothers witnessed some of the most dramatic historical events of the nineteenth century. Joseph, newly married, was called with Brigham in 1834 to march with Zion’s Camp. He walked the thousand miles to Missouri and another thousand home again to Kirtland. He later commented, “I never went through a more severe trial of my faith.”<noteMarker noteRef="17">17</noteMarker></para>
				<para paraID="64">Joseph also was an eyewitness to the Haun’s Mill massacre in October 1838. He and his family were miraculously spared. His description of that dreadful event was subsequently published in the <emphasis>Millennial Star </emphasis>(see vol. 16, p. 508).</para>
				<para paraID="65">Lorenzo and his second wife, Harriet Page Wheeler, were numbered among the first small company of pioneers, led by Brigham Young, to enter the Salt Lake Valley in July of 1847. They were parents of the first pioneer male child born in the valley—Lorenzo Dow Young, born 20 September 1847. “He was a bright little fellow,” wrote his uncle, “and gave great promise of life and growth, but was overtaken by that most certain of all things—death, March 22nd 1848.”<noteMarker noteRef="18">18</noteMarker> The elder Lorenzo’s long life was filled with devoted service to family, church, and community.</para>
				<para paraID="66">Phinehas, too, was a vanguard pioneer, although before his group reached the valley he and three other men volunteered to turn back and serve as guides for groups starting the trek. The first of these groups was presided over by his brother John. After Phinehas made three such excursions he finally settled permanently in Salt Lake City, where he erected a two-story adobe home and planted one of the first orchards in the valley. He became active in politics, grew award-winning strawberries, and instigated a tree-planting effort which eventually yielded Salt Lake City’s Liberty Park. The brothers enjoyed each other’s company in Salt Lake City. Joseph and Lorenzo lived near Brigham and often joined his family for evening singing and prayers.</para>
				<para paraID="67">Most of the Young family continued strong in their faith. In 1857 Brigham noted, “My father and stepmother embraced the plan of salvation as revealed through Joseph the Prophet; and four of my brothers, five sisters, and their children and their children’s children, almost without exception, are in this Church” (<emphasis>Journal of Discourses,</emphasis> 4:281).</para>
				<para paraID="68">Nearly forty years later, Lorenzo, at eighty-three the only surviving child of John Young, recorded: “My father, my step-mother, Hannah Brown, my four brothers and five sisters, with their wives and husbands, were all members of the Church, carried out their professions and lived like true Saints, with the exception of two brothers-in-law, Of a family of twenty three, twenty one of them, if I pass away in the faith, will have lived and died Latter Day Saints.”</para>
				<para paraID="69">He then reflected, “There is so much that is near and dear to me the other side of the vail, that hides the immortal from our vision, that I feel almost impatient to burst the bands and be free.”<noteMarker noteRef="19">19</noteMarker> Five years later, in 1895, he did “burst the bands” of mortality. The last of the Young children had come home.</para>

					<para paraID="2">My bulletin board is by no means ordinary. It is a blueprint for the practical side of my life. Covered with colored cards, held in orderly rows by bright tacks, it has drawn the attention of many a passerby, who reads its contents in surprise.</para>
					<para paraID="3">For many years I formulated goals, made plans, and listed ideas that accumulated in stacks by the telephone, in the clutter at the head of the bed, in lost notebooks, or in my head. Soon these various interests and responsibilities were enormous and seemed to pursue me. I ran to accomplish important things before I forgot or lost my multiple notes.</para>
					<para paraID="4">Then inspiration struck. It is a basic fact that before you build anything you must plan it out completely. “For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost?”(<scriptureRef book="luke" chapter="14" verse="28">Luke 14:28</scriptureRef>). The result was a bulletin board that freed me from the snare of good intentions, that got me organized without chaining me. It now keeps me aware of daily, weekly, and long-range chores and goals, including a few dreams not yet on the drawing board.</para>
					<para paraID="5">I used colored cards of varied sizes, inscribed with major headings, and tacked to the board. Under each heading is a small sheet listing specifics. Some of the entries merely serve as reminders. But commitments and goals are reinforced when they are written down, so on some of them I have inserted deadlines. As I complete a goal, I cross out that item or replace the sheet.</para>
					<para paraID="6">My bulletin board is subject to constant change, allowing for my strengths, weaknesses, and current interests. A sampling of entries might include:</para>
					<para paraID="7"><emphasis>Reading: </emphasis>A list of about ten books I am reading or hope to read soon.</para>
					<para paraID="8"><emphasis>Sewing: </emphasis>Particular items needing attention—curtains, pajamas, a baby quilt.</para>
					<para paraID="9"><emphasis>Daily schedule:</emphasis> Reminders of certain chores—Tuesday, polish the bathroom; Thursday, mend. I change it, bend it, and it doesn’t restrict me, but it does give me something to work from.</para>
					<para paraID="10"><emphasis>Long-range goals:</emphasis> Classes I’d like to take, skills to develop, dream house plans, etc.</para>
					<para paraID="11"><emphasis>Weekly weight: </emphasis>My husband and I weigh each Friday and log our weight on the board.</para>
					<para paraID="12"><emphasis>Weekly goals: </emphasis>This one really untangles the week for me. It includes guests coming, visits to make, projects to finish, errands.</para>
					<para paraID="13"><emphasis>Special thoughts: </emphasis>Gems from talks or articles, letters to write, etc.</para>
					<para paraID="14"><emphasis>Current marriage goals and commitments: </emphasis>Items from our projects together, such as daily reading, vocabulary building, or a commitment not to eat after dinner. It is security for me to see these things in print.</para>
					<para paraID="15">My bulletin board is for the practical side of my life; more personal goals are not for public viewing. But my life must become a life of order, and my bulletin board is disciplining me in that direction.<strong>—Susan Arrington Hill, St. Cloud, Minnesota</strong></para>

					<para paraID="4">On the other hand, white sugar should be stored in a dry place or it will turn lumpy. The sugar should also be put into tightly closed containers. Foods stored in the utility room with the washer and dryer will need protection from the extra moisture. Dry storage areas are usually inside the home: closets, cupboards, and bedrooms.</para>

We watched open-mouthed as our dentist pulled a thread and the sleeve of his uniform came unsewed from the jacket. These were all ready-made garments, not home sewn.</para>
					<para paraID="3">One of home sewing’s greatest merits can be minimizing future mending problems. Remember:</para>
					<para paraID="4">1. To avoid frayed seams, which eventually pull apart, run a row of machine stitching near the cut edge of each seam allowance then overcast by hand or zigzag machine stitching. If the fabric is quite firm, zigzag machine stitching will suffice.</para>
					<para paraID="5">2. To prevent seams from breaking in armholes and in the crotch of pants, use a slight zigzag stitch. If you do not have a zigzag machine, stitch the seam a second time about one-sixteenth of an inch beyond the seamline, using short stitches.</para>
					<para paraID="6">3. To reinforce seams on a one-piece sleeve and bodice, such as a kimono, use twill tape, a narrow strip of selvage, or woven-edge seam tape. Raglan sleeves can also be reinforced with narrow tape.</para>
					<para paraID="7">4. To prevent ripped-out dress hems, blind hem them by machine when the fabric type permits. On lightweight and sheer fabrics, a hidden slip stitch by hand will prevent wear of the thread.</para>
					<para paraID="8">5. To reinforce waist seams, sew woven-edge seam tape or a half-inch strip of selvage over the waistline seam, stitching the seam twice.</para>
					<para paraID="9">6. To prevent rips under buttons and around buttonholes, interface all facings with a sturdy, lightweight fabric. (Use zippers instead of buttons wherever possible, especially for blouse and dress backs.)</para>
					<para paraID="10">7. Sew buttons and snaps on by hand instead of by machine. The machine needle goes back through the fabric in the same place each time, thereby weakening that area.</para>
					<para paraID="11">8. Leave lined coats open at the bottom, even in ski-type jackets. Then you can get inside to mend the seams, particularly the armhole seams that are under the most stress.<strong>—Eva S. Nuffer, Aurora, Oregon</strong></para>

					<para paraID="2">I sometimes feel overwhelmed at the number of things I think I need to do to be an effective wife, mother, homemaker, Church member, and citizen. I find myself so anxious to accomplish what needs to be done that I do not feel calm and relaxed with my children. I’m always saying, “Hurry!” and I go to bed at night feeling a bit like a massive truck that has rolled over mountain roads, crushing delicate wildflowers in a dogged determination to reach a certain destination by nightfall.</para>
					<para paraID="3">So today I decided to gather a few “wildflowers”—those special, wonderful moments when the rush of doing melts away in the joy of being. I took a walk with my five-year-old son. Leaving the telephone, the laundry, and some dusty furniture behind for awhile, we held hands as we walked, sharing the smell of freshly plowed dirt and the sounds of birds welcoming spring. We stretched out on the grass beside the canal and wrote poems together.</para>
					<para paraID="4">Afterward, considering all I needed to do, I wondered if that time were wisely spent. Yet the pure joy of this afternoon warmed my heart and gave me incentive to be a better mother. My dad has always told me, “You can do <emphasis>anything</emphasis> you want, but not <emphasis>everything</emphasis>.” My decision to spend some time with my son today necessarily eliminated a myriad of other ways I could have spent it. But that particular time will never come again.</para>

					<para paraID="2">The air is calmer today outside my study window, a relief from last week’s wind. The Virginia creeper is turning red and gold, the crab apples are yellow, and the yard is trimmed and ready for winter. I have always loved fall.</para>
					<para paraID="3">The past few weeks I have been preoccupied with my Relief Society lesson on “life stages”—our growth from childhood through old age, and our feelings toward each stage. I fall into the category of middle years. Fall reminds me of this stage—calm, aware of life and color, appreciating the beauty and miracle around me. It is a harvest, in a way, of the earlier years, with wonderful children, grandchildren, and friends to enjoy, more time for reflection, more time for self.</para>
					<para paraID="4">Now what do I say about it to all those ladies? Can I share my love and appreciation for life without exposing delicate feelings? Should I do a brave performance, or can I just be me? I do not want to be analyzed or judged, but I have finally come to the conclusion that being me is okay. I am not perfect, but I do not expect others to be perfect either. I find I am now less critical and more loving.</para>
					<para paraID="5">I like being where I am. I am thankful for all the blessings of fall—the golden leaf, the last rose, and especially family and friends.<strong>—Colleen Poulson, Salt Lake City, Utah</strong></para>

			<para paraID="5">As a nine-year-old Colorado farm girl toying with her family’s new parlor organ in 1884, she was perhaps not unusual. But as a ten-year-old organist accompanying a stake choir, Edna Helena Coray was a prodigy. The only child of Howard Knowlton and Mary Lusk Coray, Edna was musically precocious from her earliest years. Wise teachers nourished Edna’s gift, and by age thirteen she was official organist of the San Luis Stake and was a sought-after music teacher.</para>
			<para paraID="6">As a teenager, Edna pursued both solitary and social delights. “Being an only child,” she wrote years later, “I had no playmates except at school, and recess time was filled with boisterous sport. A shy, solemn little boy from Tennessee gradually joined in our games, and I enjoyed them all the more, because of him!”<noteMarker noteRef="1">1</noteMarker> Edna and the “shy, solemn little boy,” James Wesley Dyer, were schoolmates in Sanford, Colorado, for three years. Their paths separated when the Corays moved to Salt Lake City in the spring of 1892, when Edna was sixteen and a half. But they were to meet again.</para>
			<para paraID="7">In Salt Lake City, Edna studied pipe organ under Joseph J. Daynes, Tabernacle organist. She progressed rapidly, often spending six or more hours a day at the organ. Before many months had passed she was invited by Evan Stephens, director of the Tabernacle Choir, to join the choir and thus be available as an on-call substitute for Daynes.</para>
			<para paraID="8">Edna’s commitment to music was wholehearted but sometimes less than confident. She wrote often to “dearest Papa,” who had returned to Colorado to farm for most of a year before joining his family in Salt Lake City. “If I only knew for <emphasis>sure, </emphasis>just how I advance in Dayne’s estimation,” she wrote. “He always, or usually says, ‘You’re doing very well; I’m quite pleased,’ etc., etc., but I suppose he sees I’m easily discouraged, and so says that to make me feel better.”</para>
			<para paraID="9">Early in 1893, lovely seventeen-year-old Edna confided to her father the course of her romantic infatuations. “There are so many ‘pretty’ boys in our ward,” she wrote, “that my heart is divided into about 15 or 20 parts, owing to my admiration for about that many. I can’t concentrate more than one<emphasis> part </emphasis>to any <emphasis>one </emphasis>person, so the pieces are deplorably scattered.”</para>
			<para paraID="10">A few months later, just following her eighteenth birthday, her “scattered” affections became shattered hopes. Within days, her clear, smooth complexion erupted with the raw, swollen sores of <emphasis>lupus vulgaris, </emphasis>a tubercular condition of the skin. To discourage infection and to reduce embarrassment, she swathed her face in a white gauze bandage mask. Removing it only for brief periods, she wore it for the next two decades.</para>
			<para paraID="11">Late in her life, Edna recalled those days: “During my late teens and early twenties, my life became virtually that of a shut-in; I never went to social gatherings of any kind, but just played for my Ward choir Sundays (or for funerals), and stayed home with my books and piano on week days. … One blessed friend … went with me every day to the Doctor’s, and was the only one besides him who knew what I suffered.”</para>
			<para paraID="12">She enrolled for a program in English at the University of Utah sometime after 1893, and completed a bachelor of arts degree in 1902 at age twenty-seven, the only woman in a graduating class of eight.</para>
			<para paraID="13">The electric face treatments, which always hurt, rarely helped. She was confronted with curious stares and embarrassing moments. “As I was on my way to school this morning,” she wrote in 1901, “the car-conductor and a student got to playing, and the latter pushed the former and as he fell over toward me, his elbow struck my sore face, hurting terribly, and making it bleed, much to the surprise of the car full of people. I was so mortified I could have died, but I just cried a little and went up to the University. When I saw that my bandage was all stained I turned it as best I could, and with Miss Emma Christensen’s kind help, I managed to cover the stains so I could get home. … I’m so soul-weary of being shut out alike from usefulness and enjoyment through my disfigurement!”</para>
			<para paraID="14">Edna penned a fervent resolution in February 1901: “If the Lord will grant me restoration from the affliction I am now suffering, I hereby solemnly covenant, and pledge myself to use whatever talents I may possess for the benefit of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to the full extent of my power. This covenant I make before God, Angels, and Men, and may the All Merciful One accept it. Amen.”</para>
			<para paraID="15">The promise was heartfelt, and Edna struggled to hope that one day her face would be healed. Months passed; the hopes and supplications continued, while her face remained an open wound. She took on a few piano students, immersed herself in studies at the university, and accompanied ward musicians.</para>
			<para paraID="16">Brighter moments came. A new organ for the Sixteenth Ward arrived; Edna was asked to play for a missionary farewell concert. Her first public organ appearance, performing before a full house, established her reputation as a first-rate musician. Subsequently, she was in frequent demand as both a soloist and accompanist. Hundreds of concert programs with her name appearing four, six, eight times or more, are among her collected memorabilia in the Brigham Young University archives.</para>
			<para paraID="17">Late in the spring of 1902, Edna took her first lessons at the great Tabernacle organ under Professor John J. McClellan, a brilliant organist. She sometimes played semiweekly Tabernacle organ recitals in his stead, and accompanied the choir in McClellan’s absence. She also played at general conference meetings. But the two did not always agree, and as the continual pressures wore upon her, she grew less and less enchanted with the responsibility.</para>
			<para paraID="18">Meanwhile, her father had arranged for Edna to study under Professor Thomas Radcliffe at the First Congregational Church. The professor, she noted, was “a perfect gentleman and a thorough master.” She studied with him for three years, progressing rapidly. Then Radcliffe died suddenly. “My beloved teacher and friend! … What can I <emphasis>now </emphasis>do to advance in my organ studies? He has left me alone, and I can see no further prospects!” Edna resolved to perpetuate Radcliffe’s philosophy: “If you regard your music as part of the worship of the Almighty, then the best you can offer is none too good!”</para>
			<para paraID="19">The struggle with <emphasis>lupus </emphasis>continued. X-ray treatments helped sporadically; Edna could sometimes remove the bandage for days. But always the disease—now aggravated by severe burns from the treatments—returned. Yet without fail, her musical services continued. Combined, her service on the organ bench—as Sixteenth Ward organist (thirty years), Lake Stake organist (fifteen years), and general organist for the Relief Society (thirty years), totaled seventy-five years. A gifted composer as well, Edna published at least one secular composition and several religious pieces.</para>
			<para paraID="20">Finally the skin condition subsided entirely; but her face remained severely scarred.</para>
			<para paraID="21">And what of that “shy, solemn little boy” of Colorado days? Edna Coray married him in the Salt Lake Temple on 27 August 1929, her fifty-fourth birthday. James had earlier married, fathered several children, and been widowed. He and Edna shared twenty-seven years together until James’s death in 1956.</para>
			<para paraID="22">Edna Helena Coray Dyer died 1 May 1960 and was buried in the Salt Lake Memorial Cemetery, with a small packet of James’s letters at her feet.</para>
			<para paraID="23">It is difficult to fully assess this remarkable woman’s spiritual gifts, her literary and artistic sensitivity, and her endearing, enduring humor. But we do know the depth of her love for others, expressed during a 1944 sacrament meeting at which she was honored: “Your presence here … is a token of respect that means more to me than a glittering medal from some worldly potentate. I can only say, I thank you with all my heart and wish that such measure of friendship as you have meted unto me, may be measured to you again, heaped up, pressed down, and running over!”<noteMarker noteRef="2">2</noteMarker></para>

			<para paraID="4">We have found that preparing ahead of time for new experiences can save a lot of unhappiness and embarrassment—for both children and parents. And when they have some idea of what is expected in a new situation, children are not so apt to be frightened by it. Their preparation may involve discussion, visiting a new place, role playing, or any combination of these.</para>
			<para paraID="5">For example, simply talking about proper behavior—en route to an event, if not before—can help both child and parent. The conversation can take the form of questions (“How many cups of punch should you ask for at great-grandma’s eightieth birthday party?”) or cautions (“We must talk in quiet voices and not run around while we’re in the funeral home”).</para>
			<para paraID="6">Parents can also direct youngsters to avoid embarrassing comments such as, “Boy, grandma, you sure look wrinkled!” Of course you can’t anticipate everything a child might say, but after a remark like this, you can take the child aside and explain that it isn’t nice to tell people they look wrinkled, then review a few positive things he might say instead.</para>
			<para paraID="7">Helping children become familiar with a strange environment reduces their fear and lets them feel more secure. This is why schools have prekindergarteners spend some time in the classroom with the new teacher before the school year actually begins. Many hospitals are now holding preadmission “parties” for young patients to acquaint them with the place and procedures. We took advantage of public tours in a new hospital to let our own children see what’s inside that building where mom goes and comes home with a new baby.</para>
			<para paraID="8">Also, children love to act things out, so playing Sunday School (with emphasis on reverence and proper church behavior), having a practice meal with the good china and best manners, or pretending the family is at a wedding reception can be fun for them as well as a valuable learning experience.</para>
			<para paraID="9">Then there’s preparation for the new baby. In special family home evenings before the due date, we have discussed premortal life, shown pictures of each child as a new baby, and sometimes had the children cut and paste pictures of babies from old magazines. We’ve also gift-wrapped items the new baby will need and hidden them throughout the house for a treasure hunt. The children have a great time unwrapping the gifts and telling about them. They also practice safe ways of holding and carrying a baby. Each child has welcomed the arrival of the new member of the family; we have made sure that all existing children know they are loved and will continue to be important.</para>
			<para paraID="10">Another special family home evening is held as the school year is about to begin. We discuss safety rules, then role-play walking to school: a stranger (dad or mom) approaches the child and offers a ride or something to eat; the child responds with a quick “No thanks!” and makes a hasty exit. We play “lunchroom” (using aluminum TV dinner trays) and practice carrying the trays, saving dessert until last, having quiet conversation, and using good table manners. The children like to be the teachers during the classroom part of the rehearsal.</para>
			<para paraID="11">Often, when children misbehave in a new setting, it’s simply because they have not been prepared for it ahead of time. Preparation brings confidence, and taking time to prepare them for a new experience seems to make it go smoother for everyone involved—including parents.</para>

			<para paraID="5">One hundred and fifty years ago, the Lord restored the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth through the boy prophet, Joseph Smith. Through this young man, knowledge and information which had been lost, forgotten, changed, and, in some cases, denied, for nineteen centuries were once again made available to the children of God.</para>
			<para paraID="6">In most cases the inhabitants of the earth were no more ready to receive the gospel in 1830 than they had been to receive it from the Savior himself nineteen hundred years before. As the Prophet described it, the vision and understanding of the people suffered because of the traditions of their fathers—and I would add—because of their mothers as well.</para>
			<para paraID="7">The people cried “blasphemy” when the Prophet declared that not only could God still talk to man (revelation had <emphasis>not </emphasis>ceased), but that He had talked to him. Joseph Smith was denounced when be claimed that God and Christ had corporeal bodies—separate, distinct, and tangible.</para>
			<para paraID="8">But this was only the beginning of new, revealed truths to come to the world through this young prophet chosen to usher in the last dispensation. And history shows that the world at large was still not ready, able, or willing to receive most of what he taught.</para>
			<para paraID="9">One newly restored truth that the Prophet taught—hard for the world to swallow in his day, and still misinterpreted by many in our own time—was the Lord’s view of women. The Prophet taught that men and women are of equal value and of equal importance in the sight of God. He preached that in order for a man to achieve his highest potential (the celestial kingdom and godhood) he must have a woman—equally exalted—by his side and sealed to him forever! (See <scriptureRef book="dc" chapter="131" verse="1-4">D&amp;C 131:1–4</scriptureRef>.) A just God would not require the yoking of two unequal beings for eternity. Building upon the foundation laid by Joseph Smith, subsequent prophets taught that God was not single, but married; that there is a Heavenly Father and a Heavenly Mother; and that we were made in their image: male and female children. (See James R. Clark, comp., <emphasis>Messages of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, </emphasis>6 vols., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75, 4:203, 205.)</para>
			<para paraID="10">As temples were built and temple ordinances restored, our understanding of the male/female relationship has increased: Both men and women are conditionally sealed to become kings and queens, priests and priestesses. Both share the blessings of the priesthood. Both share the gifts of the spirit (i.e., to heal, to be healed, to speak in tongues, to prophesy, etc.).</para>
			<para paraID="11">As Paul stated, “neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord” (<scriptureRef book="1-cor" chapter="11" verse="11">1 Cor. 11:11</scriptureRef>). This is true even though marriage may or may not happen during our stay in the second estate. President Kimball stated in his talk to women in September 1979:</para>
			<para paraID="12">“Sometimes to be tested and proved requires that we be temporarily deprived—but righteous women and men will one day receive <emphasis>all—</emphasis>think of it, sisters—<emphasis>all </emphasis>that our Father has! It is not only worth waiting for; it is worth living for!</para>
			<para paraID="13">“Meanwhile, one does not need to be married or a mother in order to keep the first and second great commandments—those of loving God and our fellowmen—on which Jesus said hang all the law and all the prophets!” (<emphasis>Ensign, </emphasis>Nov. 1979, p. 103).</para>
			<para paraID="14">It is important for a woman to learn in this life her eternal role so that when she is sealed she will be prepared and ready—with all her heart—to function in and glorify that role. That means being ready and prepared to function as a full partner in a celestial team—without having to look <emphasis>up </emphasis>because of any feeling of inferiority, or look <emphasis>down </emphasis>because of any feeling of superiority, but look <emphasis>across </emphasis>into the eyes of an equally prepared, equally magnificent eternal mate.</para>
			<para paraID="15">Such an exalted role for women was mind-boggling for nineteenth-century America. Here, as elsewhere, society was male dominated, and men were generally regarded as being superior. Men were not only to be protectors of women, but were responsible for their salvation as well.</para>
			<para paraID="16">When the Prophet Joseph Smith organized the Relief Society after the pattern of the priesthood in 1842, he told the women that they were responsible for their own sins. For some this was a radical thought in those days. He taught them they were responsible for their own salvation, that they had access to every needed blessing the priesthood gives, that they also had direct access to the Holy Ghost and to spiritual gifts and they also had direct access to the Savior—to model him, become like him, be heirs in his kingdom. (See <emphasis>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, </emphasis>sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1938, pp. 223–229.)</para>
			<para paraID="17">The Prophet removed some of the excuses afforded woman in her passive, dependent role, and made her responsible for herself! Many of the early Mormon sisters caught his vision for women, got in the game, and ran with the ball. Women in Utah and Wyoming had the vote fifty years before women in the country received it generally. And as we read and ponder the writings of many nineteenth-century Latter-day Saint women, we know that they knew who they were.</para>
			<para paraID="18">But, as is true with most good things, Satan has devised a counterfeit to God’s plan for women. And as we have watched the growth of the “women’s movement” in the hands of the world, we have been aghast at some of the excesses and directions it has taken. Whereas God wants us to know that men and women are of equal value and importance, the devil—subtly changing the truth—would have us believe we are <emphasis>not different, </emphasis>but <emphasis>the same. </emphasis>The Lord’s way is for men and women to become “like” each other only as we each take upon ourselves the Savior’s universal traits; the devil’s way would be for us to become a unisex society. We must be careful not to confuse the phony with the real thing.</para>
			<para paraID="19">Some women complain that they have no strong role models in the scriptures. That is not true. We have many models there. And our main one is the Savior, himself. Nowhere is it written that he is a model for men only; and nowhere is it written that men and women should each be allowed only half of his traits! The world has divided up personality traits that should be characteristic of both men and women, and has labeled some of them “masculine” and some of them “feminine.” Latter-day prophets <emphasis>do </emphasis>teach that men and women have biological, emotional, and other differences, but we should be careful about assigning mutually exclusive traits to one sex or the other. Nowhere, for example, does the Lord say that tenderness, kindness, charity, faithfulness, patience, gentleness, and compassion are strictly female traits and should be utilized by women only. And nowhere does he say that courage, strength, determination, and leadership should be the exclusive prerogative of men. Any notion that God desired that women be passive should have been dispelled when the Prophet told women that they were responsible for their own salvation.</para>
			<para paraID="20">Women aren’t the only ones who suffer from sexual categorization; since men are also charged to become Christlike, a heavy burden is placed on a man when he realizes that many of the traits that will make him Christlike have been labeled by the world as feminine—and that by taking upon himself those characteristics he runs the risk of having his masculinity seriously questioned by his peers.</para>
			<para paraID="21">But while we oppose assigning gender to Christlike personality traits—believing that both men and women should possess them—we also oppose the current movement toward making men and women exactly alike. Again, that’s the imitation. The Lord’s plan is for men and women to become “like” each other only as we truly take upon ourselves the Savior’s characteristics. If we are true to our natures as the Lord has outlined them for us, our basic masculinity and femininity will not come into question. We should all have both strength and sensitivity, courage and compassion, tenacity and tenderness. And as we best incorporate all those traits within our beings, we will be true to the male or female in us, which has been part of us since the beginning.</para>
			<para paraID="22">If our sexual identity is based solely on our outward visible activities, the situation is serious—and complicated—indeed. The Savior was not effeminate when he clasped the Nephite children to his bosom and blessed them and wept; neither was my great-great-grandmother unwomanly when she, as a widow, took the reins in her own hands and drove a team of oxen across the plains to Utah. If we feel a woman lacks femininity simply because she is magnificent on the playing field, or a man lacks masculinity simply because he is a great artist, I think we are missing the point.</para>
			<para paraID="23">If men are to be obedient and sacrificial, like the Savior, how can a man achieve his highest potential with only “macho” traits? And if the woman is to reach her highest potential in her creative and nurturing role, how can she achieve it by being helpless and dependent?</para>
			<para paraID="24">President Kimball, in essence, has been urging women to get in condition, get involved in the life around them, and in more positive ways become a greater influence for good on what is happening in the world. He has urged women to become educated, to become gospel scholars, to develop every talent with which the Lord has blessed them, and then to use those talents for the benefit of mankind. We need to learn and then teach each other the exalted role of women as revealed by the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We need to be sure our spouses understand it. And if we have children, we need to be sure that our sons and our daughters understand it.</para>
			<para paraID="25">The Prophet Joseph said in 1842 that the key was now turned in behalf of women, and that knowledge and intelligence would flow down henceforth (see <emphasis>Teachings, </emphasis>p. 229). President Kimball put it this way to women in September 1979:</para>
			<para paraID="26">“Much of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world (in whom there is often such an inner sense of spirituality) will be drawn to the Church in large numbers. This will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that the women of the Church are seen as distinct and different—in happy ways—from the women of the world.”</para>
			<para paraID="27">He also counseled:</para>
			<para paraID="28">“You must be wise in the choices that you make, but we do not desire the women of the Church to be uninformed or ineffective. You will be better mothers and wives, both in this life and in eternity, if you sharpen the skills you have been given and use the talents with which God has blessed you” (<emphasis>Ensign, </emphasis>Nov. 1979, pp. 104, 103).</para>
			<para paraID="29">We have been taught that where much is given, much is expected. If we as Latter-day Saints really understand the gospel of Jesus Christ and all it offers women, we know that no blessing can be withheld from us if we are prepared and worthy to receive it. The Lord expects us to be exemplars and teachers. I pray that we may catch the understanding and vision of who we really are—and so be.</para>

			<para paraID="6">This past October I attended a women’s conference. One of the sessions was entitled “Mormon Women: Three Perspectives.” I listened with interest to the panel members and the three women who responded. I have reflected frequently on the ideas expressed at that session. In retrospect, I have found it interesting that there were few, if any, references to the scriptures, teachings of the Church, or words of our prophets. My perspective as a Mormon woman was not expressed in that session. I am grateful for this opportunity to share my viewpoint and beliefs.</para>
			<para paraID="7">I want to preface my comments with some personal background. I came to Brigham Young University ten years ago this past fall to begin work on a graduate degree. I selected BYU because I had become professionally acquainted with one of the faculty members here and I wanted to study with her. I knew little about BYU and less about Mormons. Yet, when I came to this campus, I felt at home; I was comfortable here. I sensed the difference which is frequently spoken of by visitors to our campus. I had come here on a one-year leave of absence from Iowa State University. When it came time to return to my position, I resigned in order to stay at BYU and complete my studies. The following summer, a class of students whom I had taught presented me with a Triple Combination. That gift, and the sincerity and feeling with which it was presented, had a great impact on my life. I began a serious investigation of the Church, and in March 1971, I was baptized. I joined the Church after much study and against the wishes of my parents and friends. I joined the Church because I believed that the Prophet Joseph Smith had indeed received a revelation from our Heavenly Father to restore the gospel.</para>
			<para paraID="8">As I have continued to study the scriptures and explore the teachings of the Church, my testimony has been strengthened. I have gained new understanding, as well as meaning and direction in my life as a woman.</para>
			<para paraID="9">Since my conversion, I have often wished that I had been raised in a Latter-day Saint home, that my parents and other members of my family had a testimony of the restored gospel. However, because I was raised out of the Church, I feel I have a special appreciation for the teachings of the Church—which we sometimes confuse with certain cultural practices, which are a matter of preference, not doctrine. I will discuss the <emphasis>teachings </emphasis>of the Church here, as they relate to women.</para>
			<para paraID="10">We live in a time when there is much talk of equal rights, but this is not a new notion in the gospel. The scriptures and the prophets have clearly taught that “God is no respecter of persons” (<scriptureRef book="acts" chapter="10" verse="34">Acts 10:34</scriptureRef>). President Kimball reaffirmed this when he spoke to the women of the Church last fall. He said, “We had full equality as [God’s] spirit children. We have equality as recipients of God’s perfected love for each of us” (<emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> Nov. 1979, p. 102).</para>
			<para paraID="11">Equality, however, does <emphasis>not </emphasis>imply sameness. Although men and women are equal in the sight of the Lord, their eternal roles and assignments differ. Men’s primary duties are associated with fatherhood and the priesthood; women have responsibilities relating to motherhood and sisterhood. By virtue of these assignments, men are directly responsible for Church governance and thus have organizational and administrative duties. Women, on the other hand, have specific responsibility to create and nurture.</para>
			<para paraID="12">Because men hold the priesthood and are therefore often more visible in the operations of the Church, some people assume men are more important and more competent than women. But Elder John A. Widtsoe of the Quorum of the Twelve made it clear that the priesthood is not a reward for competency or excellence:</para>
			<para paraID="13">“Women of a congregation … may be wiser, far greater in mental powers, even greater in actual power of leadership than the men who preside over them. That signifies nothing. The Priesthood is not bestowed on the basis of mental power but is given to good men and they exercise it by right of divine gift, called upon by the leaders of the Church. Woman has her gift of equal magnitude” (<emphasis>Priesthood and Church Government, </emphasis>Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1954, p. 90).</para>
			<para paraID="14">On another occasion he said, “No man who understands the gospel believes that he is greater than his wife, or more beloved of the Lord, because he holds the priesthood” (<emphasis>Evidences and Reconciliations, </emphasis>Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1960, p. 308).</para>
			<para paraID="15">Although women do not hold the priesthood, they are partakers of every blessing necessary for salvation. The temple endowment makes this clear. The general ordinances of the temple are all performed by authority of the priesthood, and women have access to all of them. And the instructions, ordinances, and covenants of the temple endowment are basically the same for men and women. In the temple men are prepared for their roles as kings and priests, and women are prepared to become queens and priestesses. Woman stands beside the man, “a joint-in heritor with him in the fulness of all things. Exaltation and eternal increase is her lot as well as his. Godhood is not for men only; it is for men and women together” (Bruce R. McConkie, <emphasis>Mormon Doctrine, </emphasis>2nd ed., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966, p. 844).</para>
			<para paraID="16">The differences between men and women are designed to be complementary and unifying, not divisive and separating. The ultimate plan is for achievement of a perfect balance, with neither sex to be unduly emphasized. President Kimball reinforced this when he spoke of marriage as a full partnership: “We do not want our LDS women to be <emphasis>silent </emphasis>partners or <emphasis>limited </emphasis>partners in that eternal assignment. Please,” he said to women, “be a <emphasis>contributing</emphasis> and<emphasis> full </emphasis>partner” (<emphasis>Ensign, </emphasis>Nov. 1978, p. 106).</para>
			<para paraID="17">In addition to recognizing the differences in eternal roles of men and women, we must remember that men and women do have qualities and characteristics that distinguish them from each other. Elder Bruce R. McConkie emphasized and paid tribute to some feminine qualities during his remarks at the dedication of the Nauvoo Monument to Women (see <emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> January 1979, pp. 61–63). He cited Eve’s spiritual sensitivity when she said, “Were it not for our transgression we never should … have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption” (<scriptureRef book="moses" chapter="5" verse="11">Moses 5:11</scriptureRef>). She had come to recognize that she and Adam needed to partake of the fruit. Elder McConkie also stated that together Adam and Eve set the “perfect pattern” for perfecting the family. Their complementary relationship can be instructive for us.</para>
			<para paraID="18">Rebecca provides another example of woman’s spiritual insight. Elder McConkie suggested that she understood her obligation to “engineer and … arrange so that things are done in a way that will result in the salvation of more of our Father’s children.” You will remember that Isaac, Rebecca’s aged husband, was preparing, in accordance with the law, to pronounce a special blessing upon his firstborn son, Esau. Rebecca knew, however, that it was their righteous son, Jacob, who should have the blessing, for the Lord had revealed it to her before the children were born. She therefore “engineered” the situation so that her husband did indeed confer the blessings of Abraham upon Jacob. Here we have another demonstration of obedience to higher law.</para>
			<para paraID="19">Elder McConkie is quick to affirm that women have, from the beginning, been entitled to impressive spiritual endowments. He indicates that “Where spiritual things are concerned, as pertaining to all the gifts of the Spirit, with reference to the receipt of revelation, the gaining of testimonies, the seeing of visions, in all matters that pertain to godliness and holiness and which are brought to pass as a result of personal righteousness—in all these things men and women stand in a position of absolute equality before the Lord.”</para>
			<para paraID="20">The differences between men and women are eternal differences. Not only are men and women gifted differently to accomplish the purpose of providing mortal bodies for immortal spirits, but they have differing qualities and strengths, as well as unique ways of perceiving the same experiences. The whole truth emerges only when both perceptions are applied. Acknowledgment of these differences lends special significance to the Apostle Paul’s observation that “neither is the man without the woman, neither is the woman without the man, in the Lord” (<scriptureRef book="1-cor" chapter="11" verse="11">1 Cor. 11:11</scriptureRef>).</para>
			<para paraID="21">I agree with the concluding paragraph of a paper prepared last year by the Advisory Committee on Women’s Concerns at BYU, which states,</para>
			<para paraID="22">“As we come to realize how essential this two-sided vision is in the search for and assimilation of truth, in the daily living of lives, in the happy functioning of families, we are impressed to suggest that … just as women need the support and counsel of men in their particular Church callings, so do men need the support and counsel of women in theirs” (<emphasis>Thoughts on the Concerns of Women at Brigham Young University and Elsewhere, </emphasis>29 May 1979, p. 12).</para>
			<para paraID="23">While I am convinced that full equality of men and women is an important precept of the restored gospel, I also believe there is sometimes a disparity between our doctrines and our actual practices. Our prophet himself acknowledged this when he spoke at the general priesthood meeting last October. After describing specific ways in which sisters of the Church were being treated condescendingly by some individual members, President Kimball made an important distinction: “I mention all these things, my brethren, not because the doctrines or the teachings of the Church regarding women are in any doubt, but because in some situations our behavior is of doubtful quality” (<emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> Nov. 1979, p. 49).</para>
			<para paraID="24">President Kimball has counseled women of the Church to appreciate the gospel’s implications concerning the eternal nature of our individual identities. He has stressed the importance of each woman experiencing for herself the perfect love of our Father in Heaven. There is no question that our prophet expects women to reach their highest potential—eternal progression and the possibility of godhood. I believe that his admonition to the women of the Church is to help prepare us for our immensely important role in building up the latter-day kingdom. You will recall his encouragement to study the scriptures, set goals, apply ourselves and learn all we can. He said that women should be as concerned about the capacity to communicate as they are to sew and preserve food, and that “much of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world (in whom there is often such an inner sense of spirituality) will be drawn to the Church in large numbers. This will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that women of the Church are seen as distinct and different—in happy ways—from the women of the world.<nb/>…</para>
			<para paraID="25">“Thus it will be that female exemplars of the Church will be a significant force in both the numerical and the spiritual growth of the Church in these last days” (<emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> Nov. 1979, pp. 103–104).</para>
			<para paraID="26">I have found that the scriptures and teachings of the Church help me better understand my place in the eternal scheme of things. As a result of my conversion, I have become personally acquainted with the Savior and his saving principles. I have experienced direction, vision, and that peace “which passeth all understanding.” I strive daily to overcome weaknesses and to prepare myself to participate in building up the Kingdom of God in preparation for the second coming of our Savior.</para>

					<para paraID="4">Interviews with three stake presidents in the wake of Mount St. Helens’s eruption in Washington find the members coping well, helping their neighbors, and rethinking their preparations for the future.</para>
					<para paraID="5">President W. Lee Robinson of the Longview Washington Stake reports that his stake, very close to the volcano, suffered the greatest physical damage from the first eruption on 18 May, when mudslides reshaped rivers’ courses and demolished homes like matchsticks.</para>
					<para paraID="6">Kelso Ward, aware of the danger, had prepared contingency plans to move members from low-lying areas to higher ground if the need arose. “When that wall of water started coming down the river, the contingency plan went into effect,” he says. “There were a few problems when bridges were either washed out or closed because they were unsafe, but the plan basically did work. By late afternoon all of our people were either accounted for or located.” He praised the priesthood for its organization, particularly the home teachers.</para>
					<para paraID="7">No attempts were made to transfer food storage items to high ground. “We relied on what the hosts had, and it was more than adequate,” he says. “But we’ve been doing some re-evaluation since then and most of us have decided that we wouldn’t be prepared for a long emergency. Water was one of our most critical items. We were never without water but we were being rationed. It made us think again about what we needed.”</para>
					<para paraID="8">In addition to the shock of the physical destruction, President Robinson reports depression because of “the ash and the darkness. When the sun doesn’t shine, you start to think pretty gloomy thoughts.”</para>
					<para paraID="9">The bright side of the situation was the greater unity of ward members. Bishop Steven H. Pond of Kelso Ward set an example for his people by taking in his nonmember neighbors when they found themselves in difficulty.</para>
					<para paraID="10">And plans for the future? “We’re going to reevaluate what happened and make it the subject of one of our leadership meetings with the elders quorum presidents and bishops.”</para>
					<para paraID="11">The Spokane Washington Stake is “290 miles away from Mount St. Helens as the crow flies and we could never have imagined that something that far away could spew so much material so far,” marvels Stake President Mark R. Bickley. The Spokane area, more fortunate than some of the areas south, received about .8 inches of ash.</para>
					<para paraID="12">“I’d been in personal priesthood interviews all day and hadn’t even heard that the volcano had erupted,” he recalls. “Someone finally told me that a big black cloud was headed our way. When I went home at three, it was starting to get dark and I turned on my headlights. In a few minutes, it was pitch black.”</para>
					<para paraID="13">For the next three days, Spokane was in a state of emergency with all of the businesses closed down. “After the initial shock,” he says, “we realized that the real damage was around the volcano and that we could cope with it. The major problem is the ash. It just won’t go away. It’s so fine and so heavy that even rain won’t soak it down.”</para>
					<para paraID="14">The problems were complicated by an initial shortage of information. First came a report that the ash would produce a sulphuric acid that would take the finish off cars. “That turned out to be false. Then they said it was abrasive. That turned out to be true. When we wiped it off the cars, we had to be careful of the finishes.” Another report suggested the possibility of silicosis from the silicon content; presently it seems that the silicon content is not high enough to constitute a danger.</para>
					<para paraID="15">“After it was all over,” summarizes President Bickley, “we realized that we had had a surprising experience and a frightening experience, but the Saints in the area took it very well. Most of them were prepared to stay home for a long period of time and their food storage was in good shape; it’s something we’ve stressed here for a number of years.</para>
					<para paraID="16">“But at a stake conference soon after—Elder James E. Faust of the Quorum of the Twelve was a visitor—it was discussed a great deal and we decided that the Lord was trying to tell us something—that we needed to be better prepared to cope physically and spiritually with disasters.”</para>
					<para paraID="17">For Lew Judd Allsop, president of the Yakima Washington Stake, the eruption also came as a complete surprise. A civil engineer by profession and an apple grower on the side, President Allsop was stunned by “the amount of material that blew out.” His area, about eighty miles from Mount St. Helens, received between a half and three-quarters of an inch. Stores were closed for a week. There was a heavy fall of the tiny apples. President Allsop, on the outskirts of the dustfall, “rigged up my sprayer and got my trees cleaned off right away and I haven’t noticed any particular damage, but they tell us that the color will be affected later.”</para>
					<para paraID="18">Disposing of the ash, a gritty and grimy job, actually brought the people closer together. “The city officials set cleaning up the downtown as the first priority and told people in the residential areas to get organized before they got there. People were asked to elect a block captain, clean off their roofs and sidewalks, push the ash into the parking lanes (away from the curbs, so the equipment could come and pick it up), and keep it wetted down. People were out on the streets with brooms, shovels, wheelbarrows, and hoses. They did more talking to each other and got to know each other better.</para>
					<para paraID="19">“And people worked together. There was some concern about food because the roads were blocked. We couldn’t drive faster than five or ten miles an hour with our lights on and the windshield wipers going all the time. But people worked together with a real good spirit and there were very few emergencies.”</para>
					<para paraID="20">Meanwhile, nearly every vacant lot has an ash mound on it. “It took between sixty and seventy people five or six hours to get the ash off the top of the stake center and piled up from the parking lot. There are thousands and thousands of tons.”</para>
					<para paraID="21">President Allsop feels that the people in his stake “really feel with the people who were in America at the time of the Crucifixion. We knew what it was, we knew what was causing it, but it was still frightening. If you hadn’t known, it would have been terrifying.”</para>

					<para paraID="10">The largest gathering of Latter-day Saints in this dispensation took place May 17–18 at the Southern California area conference in Pasadena, California. Coming from areas named after the old Spanish Missions—San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and Santa Monica—the Saints streamed into the historic Rose Bowl for four conference sessions. An estimated 25,000 women and 30,000 men, respectively, attended the women’s and priesthood sessions on Saturday with 75,000 at the Sunday morning session.</para>
					<para paraID="11">General Authorities in attendance were President Spencer W. Kimball, President Marion G. Romney, Elder Howard W. Hunter and Elder David B. Haight of the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone of the First Quorum of the Seventy, Presiding Bishop Victor L. Brown, Relief Society General President Barbara B. Smith, and Young Women General President Elaine A. Cannon.</para>

							<line paraID="14"><emphasis>You who came to San Bernardino.</emphasis></line>
						</stanza>
					</poetry>
					<para paraID="15">The conference had a sense of historical significance. Sunday morning, Elder Hunter reviewed the history of the Saints in California, beginning with a group of Mormon immigrants who sailed into San Francisco Bay on 31 July 1846, a year before the Saints arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. And in January 1847, the Mormon Battalion, after a 2,100-mile march, arrived in San Diego. They later traveled from there to the little Spanish village of El Pueblo de Los Angeles, where they stayed for a short time before most rejoined their families in Utah.</para>
					<para paraID="16">The Saints established themselves more permanently in California when in 1851 Brigham Young sent a group of about 450 to establish a colony at Fort San Bernardino under the leadership of Elder Charles C. Rich and Elder Amasa Lyman of the Quorum of the Twelve. Although this group was recalled in 1857 with the impending invasion of Johnston’s Army, the Latter-day Saints had firmly established ties in California.</para>
					<para paraID="17">Thus, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, at a Sunday luncheon, presented President Kimball with a proclamation recognizing the Church’s role in colonizing early California and the contribution Latter-day Saints have made to the quality of life in the Los Angeles area.</para>
					<para paraID="18">Several of those who addressed the area conference mentioned their ties to the area. Elder Hunter, who was called to the Quorum of the Twelve from the Pasadena area, said, “I feel I have come home,” and President Kimball recounted how he and Sister Kimball began coming to southern California “approximately fifty years ago” to obtain treatment for their son Edward who had been stricken with polio at the age of three.</para>
					<para paraID="19">Demonstrating the dramatic growth of the Church in this area, President Kimball said that when he first came to southern California there were only 17,000 members of the Church living in two stakes and 23 branches. Elder LeGrand Richards was one of those stake presidents. Today there are 77 stakes and 500 wards, with a total membership of over 250,000.</para>
					<para paraID="20">The conference seemed to have something special for everyone. Words of comfort and consolation were given to the handicapped, to single people, to childless couples, to the aged and infirm, and to those suffering from physical and emotional illnesses. One touching sight was a long line of members in wheelchairs.</para>
					<para paraID="21">The conference for this international area was translated into eight languages: Spanish, Tongan, Samoan, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese), and sign language; and the Spanish-speaking members drew special attention from President Kimball. “More than thirty years ago, while in Arizona I caught something of the vision of the future of our Hispanic brothers and sisters. … In my heart and in my mind’s eye I could see a better day dawning for them.” Speaking of their “excelling in many areas of business, industry, and education,” President Kimball said, “But this is just the beginning. They are but the vanguard of the vast numbers who will follow in their footsteps.”</para>
					<para paraID="22">Bishop Brown, encouraging the Saints to be honest in their offerings, told of a blind woman in her seventies who borrowed money to pay the tithing on the income from the family farm during the time that her inactive father was alive. “I’m not sure exactly how her payment of her father’s tithing will be transferred to his benefit in the hereafter, but I am sure what it will do for her,” he added. “Most assuredly the windows of heaven will be opened wide for her.”</para>
					<para paraID="23">Elder Haight, recognizing the presence of many investigators in the audience, spoke of the principle of revelation and testified that he knew the Lord had preserved President Kimball “to preside over his Church at this critical period of Church and world history.” Emphasizing President Kimball’s capacity for hard work, Elder Haight described meeting President Kimball at the elevator at 6:30 <small>A.M.</small> one morning. Elder Haight was carrying “a thin, executive-type briefcase.” President Kimball was carrying an old Mexican leather “trunk,” bulging with papers. Looking at Elder Haight’s case, President Kimball quipped, “David, are we working you too hard?”</para>
					<para paraID="24">The tone for the women’s session was set when President Kimball walked into the stadium. Tenderly the sisters watched the Prophet as he was helped to the speakers’ platform. Sister Cannon, speaking to that feeling, cited the “second great commandment” and women’s special capacity for love. She recounted courageous, loving acts of extraordinary women.</para>
					<para paraID="25">Sister Barbara Smith urged all women, married and single, to reach beyond themselves. She expressed concern for the spiritual tests created for women by current life-styles, and added, “It is my conviction that women have never faced more challenges to their faith than they do today. The very fact that so many choices and options are now available to women … increases our solemn obligation to understand the gospel and make choices in our lives consistent with revealed truth.”</para>
					<para paraID="26">Elder Featherstone, area supervisor for southern California, used the metaphor of the homing pigeon to symbolize the instinct we all have to return to our homes; he spoke of “a mother’s love,” the first “essential element” in nurturing that instinct, as he addressed the women’s session.</para>
					<para paraID="27">President Romney, in speaking to the women, encouraged them to “establish good habits”—the habit of daily secret prayer, the habit of “daily reading,” and “the habit of cleanliness.” Keep in mind that the Lord has said that no unclean thing can enter into his presence. Be clean housekeepers, clean in body, clothing, speech and action, in thought and feeling. Remember the Savior’s declaration, ‘Blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God’”(<scriptureRef book="3-ne" chapter="12" verse="8">3 Ne. 12:8</scriptureRef>).</para>
					<para paraID="28">Speaking in the general session, Elder Featherstone encouraged those in attendance to make a special effort to reach out to the inactive. He retold the parable of the prodigal son. “In a very real sense,” he said, “we are the keepers of the light … We gaze steadily down the road, anxious for your return. We will run with open arms, our hearts filled with compassion. We extend our deepest expressions of love—come home.”</para>
					<para paraID="29">President Kimball reaffirmed basic principles: holding family prayer and family home evening, doing missionary work, keeping personal records, living Christlike lives. He said, “We have the potential of becoming gods and we are perfecting ourselves now. The Savior lives and he tells us what to do in his holy scriptures and by the revelations of himself and his father to his prophets, past and present.”</para>
					<para paraID="30">The Lord sent his disciples into all the world, said President Kimball, and added, “I can see his arm outstretched to all the world, to the millions of people in Europe, South America, and the Orient and the hundreds of millions in India, China, and Russia and other areas of the world. And he was seeing the day when he would inspire his people so that they would go forward and spread the gospel to those people.” In a poem written for the conference, S. Dilworth Young captured the spirit of that vision:</para>

					<para paraID="4">St. Louis has a spirit that is genuine, tangible, and real—a kind of electricity that gives the city an energy all its own.</para>
					<para paraID="5">We sensed this spirit in the places we visited, in the people we met, in the things we saw, in the early morning sunlight across a city skyline dominated by the Gateway Arch.</para>
					<para paraID="6">And we felt that same spirit as hundreds of members of the St. Louis Stake cheerfully made St. Louis “a gathering place” on 7–8 June for over 10,000 members from 120 different wards and branches in twelve stakes in Missouri, Illinois, Nebraska, Kansas, and Arkansas. They gathered at the Checkerdome to hear President Spencer W. Kimball, his second counselor President Marion G. Romney, Elder Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder Marvin J. Ashton of the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder Ronald E. Poelman of the First Quorum of the Seventy, Elder Jack H Goaslind, Jr., of the First Quorum of the Seventy, Sister Marian R. Boyer, first counselor in the Relief Society general presidency, and Sister Arlene B. Darger, first counselor in the Young Women’s general presidency.</para>
					<para paraID="7">A special mother-daughter session opened the conference.</para>
					<para paraID="8">Elder Ashton urged all women in the Church to become “quality ladies in whom God is well pleased.” A “quality lady” is someone who is not offended and “has no time to be petty,” has the capacity “to love more than to be loved,” and is “the first to emphasize the good qualities in others and the last to find fault.”</para>
					<para paraID="9">Also, “quality ladies exhibit real faith.” They know the power of prayer, maintain a close, personal relationship with their Heavenly Father, and take the time to report to him every day. He urged women of the Church to oppose any social or legislative action that could adversely affect the home and the family.</para>
					<para paraID="10">Sister Boyer reminded the sisters that “loud voices” were telling women what they should be and do. “The time has come for the women in the Church to raise their voices” because “being a women is truly a calling from God.”</para>
					<para paraID="11">Sister Darger said a woman “being committed means there will be times when we’ll have to stand alone—when those we care about most may turn their backs on us. It is during these times when we must stand firm and call on our Heavenly Father for strength, for courage, for faith, and perseverance.”</para>
					<para paraID="12">Elder Poelman reminded the sisters that “the purpose of all that we do and all that we say is to gain eternal life with God the Father and his son Jesus Christ.”</para>
					<para paraID="13">Doing this depends on “a long series of individual choices. Some are large, but most are small,” infinite in number and character. But each leaves its own imprint on our immortal souls. “Too many of us,” he warned, “willingly expose ourselves to evil influences” in order to appear broad-minded or progressive, yet “righteous self-control isn’t a big price to pay for the things we really want.”</para>
					<para paraID="14">President Romney urged all young women to avoid doing anything that could bring regrets later on and added that every LDS woman should desire to marry and raise a family and to establish and maintain “an LDS home for her children.”</para>
					<para paraID="15">During the priesthood session Saturday night, Elder Packer emphasized that leaders in each priesthood group have the right to divine inspiration and the obligation “to provide each member with guidance.”</para>
					<para paraID="16">He urged all priesthood holders to “obey their parents” and to understand that they, too, are “often guided by inspiration” and cannot always explain why they feel as they do.</para>
					<para paraID="17">Elder Goaslind urged young men to think of going on a mission “not just as a duty, but as a sacred obligation.</para>
					<para paraID="18">“Jesus Christ used his early years to prepare for his mission,” he emphasized. By age twelve, he astonished the temple workers with his “knowledge.” He also developed the ability to get along with others. “When the time came, Jesus Christ was physically, mentally, and spiritually prepared.”</para>
					<para paraID="19">After extending his love and personal greetings, President Spencer W. Kimball told priesthood holders that it wasn’t important “what position they held in the priesthood as long as each priesthood holder honored his priesthood. The priesthood is something that every man in the world would want if he understood what it meant.” All the money in the world cannot buy it.</para>
					<para paraID="20">When President Kimball addressed the first general session on Sunday morning, he reminisced about his mission in the St. Louis area and pointed out St. Louis’s prominent role in early Church history. “Thousands of converts from Europe and Great Britain arrived in New Orleans by sailing ship and traveled up the Mississippi by paddleboat to St. Louis, where they found temporary employment to earn the means necessary to continue their journey. St. Louis also served as a sanctuary for hundreds of families driven from their homes in Nauvoo.”</para>
					<para paraID="21">He urged every member to “lengthen your stride” so the work of the Lord can go forward at a more rapid pace. He challenged every family to bring in one additional family some time during the coming year. “The Lord has commanded that this work be done—and not at our convenience,” he warned. “Those who fail to do so must understand that they are not doing what the Lord has commanded.”</para>
					<para paraID="22">President Edwin B. Jones, former Regional Representative of the St. Louis/Champlain, Illinois Region, assured members that if they kept the covenants they have made with God, they will find the means to meet the challenges they face.</para>
					<para paraID="23">Elder Poelman told those attending the general sessions that when we read the scriptures regularly and ponder and pray about them, we will receive the divine messages contained in them and be able to cope with the complexities of modern life.</para>
					<para paraID="24">Elder Packer counseled, “the scriptures make it clear where we should stand on every issue.” He added, “What is the greatest thing parents can do for their children? To teach them to read the scriptures.”</para>
					<para paraID="25">President Romney reminded parents that “nothing will ever replace the home or its ability to teach family members righteous principles. For a home to be successful, it must be filled with love, respect, and understanding.”</para>
					<para paraID="26">Dr. Ernest L. Wilkinson, who accompanied the official party, testified of the blessings of his association with President Kimball “both as an individual and as the Lord’s chosen representative for his church here on earth.” A typical day for President Kimball begins at 4:30 <small>A.M.</small> and continues far into the night. On one rare occasion, when he advised President Kimball to get more rest, President Kimball replied, “Your job is to help me keep going at the pace I want to go.”</para>
					<para paraID="27">He told of an experience in Bolivia. After an exhausting trip and an equally exhausting day, President Kimball decided he wanted to shake the hand of every one of the 2,900 Lamanite people in attendance. When advised of the possible medical consequences, President Kimball replied, “I don’t think you understand. I don’t want to be saved in this world. But by good deeds and hard work, I want to be exalted in the life to come.”</para>
					<para paraID="28">Elder Ashton said, “A home should be a safe harbor in difficult times. It should be a place where we can be our best, a happy place where we can love and be loved, a place where our best friends are, a place where problems can be solved. Thank God for mothers who listen, believe, and have time for their children.”</para>
					<para paraID="29">After the closing prayer, a gentle hush fell over the giant Checkerdome. It was strangely quiet. No one moved. It was obvious no one really wanted to leave.</para>
					<para paraID="30">As President Kimball rose from his chair, everyone in the Checkerdome rose in respect. Somewhere in that huge crowd, a single voice began to sing “God be with you ’til we meet again.”</para>
					<para paraID="31">President Kimball stopped and turned. Thousands of voices joined in. President Kimball looked at the congregation for a few moments and then began to wave his handkerchief slowly in all directions. Tears began to fill the eyes of those on the speakers’ stand as well as those in the audience.</para>

					<title paraID="1">Regional Meetings—On Strengthening Families</title>
				</titleBlock>
				<bodyBlock>
					<para paraID="2">Their purpose is to discuss local problems and pool local strengths. And the regional meetings held throughout the Church this year, themed to individual and family growth, did just that.</para>
					<para paraID="3">No two meetings were alike. Brief instructions from Salt Lake City indicated that “department sessions should be organized to meet local needs.” So the presentations, given by local people, dealt with local needs and local ways of filling those needs.</para>
					<para paraID="4">Talks and workshops focused on a group of goals approved by the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency. The goals, entitled “Basic Points of Emphasis for Individual(s) and Family,” encourage individual progress and family preparedness and togetherness. Leaders discussed ways of helping members select goals and follow through with them. The four goal areas are missionary work, genealogy, temporal and spiritual welfare. (For specific goals, see “Basic Points of Emphasis,” <emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> June 1980, p. 70.)</para>
					<para paraID="5">Lyle K. Porter presides over both the Albuquerque New Mexico and El Paso Texas regions. “But although the theme was the same in both regional meetings,” he says, “the ways of presenting it were different.” The planning committee for the El Paso meeting decided to choose one goal from each of the four areas of emphasis (getting out of debt, for example), and center plans and discussions around them. During the general sessions of the regional meeting, individuals gave ten-minute presentations on each of the selected goals. During departmental sessions, each group again concentrated on those goals, discussing how their quorum, auxiliary, or ward could best help people implement them.</para>
					<para paraID="6">The Albuquerque meeting was different, Brother Porter says, in that no specific goals were singled out, and no group goals were set—all of the goals were discussed on a more general level. But in that region, local leaders felt a need to devote time to workshops on leadership training. So they prepared workshops on ten leadership skills and scheduled them so that each person could choose and attend three of them.</para>
					<para paraID="7">“I’ve received a lot of favorable comments about the meetings this year,” Brother Porter says. “Because of the specific training and discussions that took place and the goals that we set, we’ll feel the good effects of the meetings all year long.”</para>
					<para paraID="8">Sidney B. Henderson, who presides over the Chico, Santa Rosa, and Napa California regions, says he’s amazed at the people’s ability to take the brief instructions from Church headquarters (less than 1 1/2 pages) and come up with such wonderful departmental sessions. At first, he says, some of the leaders were concerned that the meeting outlines didn’t give detailed instructions for the departmental sessions as in years past—only general suggestions were given. But as they studied the “Basic Points of Emphasis” and considered ways their organizations could adapt them to local situations, they became excited about tailoring the discussions to their own needs.</para>
					<para paraID="9">In the Toronto Ontario and Montreal Quebec regions, much attention was also given to ways the “Basic Points” could strengthen families. But in addition, leaders discussed the consolidated meeting schedule, the youth programs, and implementation plans for the new bishops’ central storehouse in the area. The mission presidents from local missions were there to give encouragement and training on missionary work. Regional Representative Elden C. Olsen says that the meetings were especially successful this year because instead of programming too heavily, discussion leaders allowed plenty of time for questions and answers.</para>
					<para paraID="10">A regional meeting is planned for every region in the Church—but missions that are comprised only of branches and districts are not part of the regional structure. Mission leaders have three options to choose from regarding regional meetings: to attend a regional meeting in a nearby region, to hold their own meeting on a missionwide basis, or to present the material to members at regularly scheduled district conferences.</para>
					<para paraID="11">Leaders in the Canada Halifax Mission decided to have their own meeting this year, and, appropriately, the theme of sacrifice played a big part in it. Over one hundred leaders gathered from Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick. For some, it was quite a journey. Some of them drove eight hours across Newfoundland, rode all night on a ferry from Port Aux Basques to Sidney, New Brunswick, and then drove another seven or eight hours to Moncton, New Brunswick, where the conference was held. And then they had the same two-day trip back home. They stayed with local members overnight.</para>
					<para paraID="12">According to mission president James A. Kenning, mission leaders did all they could to make the excursion worth it. They planned the meeting so that everyone would have something specific to contribute, and round-table presentations and discussions also involved everyone. The mission conference lasted longer than most regional meetings, but there was a lot to discuss: they talked about the difference Relief Society could make in the lives of women; they planned activities for the year for Young Men and Young Women; they taught clerks their duty; they discussed how to improve family and home life. Elden C. Olsen, Regional Representative of a neighboring region, presided at the conference and spoke about how to lead like the Savior leads. The feeling afterwards was that the meeting was going to make a big difference.</para>
					<para paraID="13">One side benefit of having all the leaders gather to one place, says President Kenning, was that it was the first time many of them had ever seen an LDS meetinghouse. Their ohs and ahs over the brand-new chapel in Moncton, complete with piano and organ, indicated their motivation to go back home and work for meetinghouses in their own areas.</para>
					<para paraID="14">But there’s more to regional meetings than just talk. Philip F. Low, who presides over the Indianapolis Indiana Region, says highlights of his meeting were the musical and cultural presentations. During the opening session, members of local stakes presented a twenty-minute musical program about families. And in the closing session, they had a twenty-minute slide presentation, complete with music and sound effects, about the history of the Church in Indiana—beginning with Zion’s Camp and Joseph Smith’s travels through the state. Those in attendance were happy to know how their state figured into the Sesquicentennial history of the Church.</para>
					<para paraID="15">Brother Henderson says he also encourages music and skits. In the three regional meetings under his direction, fifteen-minute skits emphasizing something taught or discussed during the meeting were part of the concluding sessions. Each of them was different—written and produced by the local members.</para>
					<para paraID="16">The 1980 regional meetings were characterized by dedication, originality, and inspiration. “I’ve heard only good comments about our meetings,” says Brother Henderson. “Of course, the meetings weren’t perfect, but this was my fifth year of regional meetings, and I can say that these were the best ones we’ve had.”</para>

					<para paraID="2">Effective 1 September, subscription rates for all three of the Church magazines will go up. The <emphasis>Ensign,</emphasis> now $6 a year, will be $8; the <emphasis>New Era</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Friend</emphasis> will go from $4 to $6 a year.</para>
					<para paraID="3">This change has been made necessary by rapidly rising publication costs, according to Verl F. Scott, business manager for the magazines. The three magazines are, and always have been, self-sustaining. Since neither advertising nor general Church funds underwrite current production costs, subscription income is the basis for funding the operating budget.</para>
					<para paraID="4">Costs have risen about fifty percent on the <emphasis>New Era</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Friend</emphasis> since the last subscription increase in 1975, and “very substantially” since the last price increase for the <emphasis>Ensign</emphasis> in 1978. Annual postage increases have been between fifteen and twenty percent. Paper and printing have averaged a ten to twelve percent increase annually, with other costs rising by about the same percentage.</para>

					<para paraID="2"><strong>Guidelines on Political Activities: </strong>As U.S. election campaigns build their momentum, the First Presidency has issued a letter to Regional Representatives, stake, mission, and district presidents, and bishops and branch presidents in the United States. The letter was to be read in sacrament meetings, and was dated 5 March 1980:</para>
					<para paraID="3">“Inasmuch as citizens of the United States are in the midst of prolonged election activities on local, state, and national levels, we reiterate our long-standing policy of encouraging members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be involved as citizens in the political process.</para>
					<para paraID="4">“We repeat the scriptural injunction that honest, wise, and good men and women should be sought for diligently and upheld in the performance of their civic duty.</para>
					<para paraID="5">“It is incumbent, therefore, upon Church members and all citizens, to study the issues, carefully consider the candidates and to exercise their right to vote after prayerful and intelligent consideration. This will insure support for such candidates and measures as will protect freedom and justice and strengthen the moral fiber of our communities and nation.</para>
					<para paraID="6">“In urging this devotion to good citizenship, we reaffirm that we take no partisan stand as to candidates or political parties, and exercise no constraint on the freedom of individuals to make their own choices in these matters. It is, however, contrary to our counsel and advice that ward, branch, or stake premises, chapels or other Church facilities be used in any way for political campaign purposes, whether it be for speech-making, distribution of literature, or class discussions. Needless to say, we are unalterably opposed to the use of our sacrament or other Church meetings for any such purposes, and those who attempt to use the Church facilities to further their political ambitions are injuring their cause and doing the Church a disservice.</para>
					<para paraID="7">“We ask that bishops and branch presidents read this message in a sacrament meeting now and later during the year as may be deemed necessary.”</para>
					<para paraID="8">The following items appeared in a recent <emphasis>Messages, </emphasis>sent to stake/mission/district presidents and to bishops and branch presidents:</para>
					<para paraID="9"><strong>“The Use of Church Buildings as Polling Places. </strong>With the approach of local and national elections, local leaders are advised that the use of Church buildings as polling places is discouraged. Such use is permitted in emergencies, provided that voting officials supervise the conduct of the public to assure that Church standards are maintained. This includes posting ‘no smoking’ signs and making other arrangements as necessary.</para>
					<para paraID="10"><strong> “Naming and Blessing Children. </strong>The naming and blessing of children should generally be done in fast and testimony meeting in the ward where the parents are members of record. The ordinance should not be performed in the regular weekly sacrament meeting. In the case of a critical illness of an infant, a worthy father, acting under the direction of the bishop, may perform the ordinance in the hospital or home.</para>
					<para paraID="11"><strong> “Confirmation. </strong>The ordinance of confirmation should generally be performed during the fast meeting. When a baptism precedes the fast meeting by more than one day, the confirmation ordinance should be performed at the baptism service.”</para>
					<para paraID="12">The following item appeared in a recent letter from President Ezra Taft Benson to heads of Church organization and departments: “Dear Brethren and Sisters:</para>
					<para paraID="13">“In order to communicate more effectively and to simplify and reduce the administrative burden on local leaders, effective immediately bulletins from Church headquarters will be included in a single <emphasis>Church Bulletin </emphasis>to be published on a monthly basis.</para>
					<para paraID="14">“This bulletin will replace <emphasis>Messages </emphasis>and all priesthood and auxiliary bulletins and general correspondence sent from all Church agencies and will contain statements on policies and procedures, training resources for stake conferences and stake and ward priesthood and auxiliary leadership meetings, suggestions and ideas for leaders, as well as reminders and other instructions. Special or confidential items will continue to be communicated occasionally by letter from the First Presidency, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric.”</para>
