				<p data-aid="" id="p1">Throughout history, Heavenly Father has ended periods of <bad>apostasy</bad> by calling prophets who receive divine authority to restore the fulness of the gospel and establish the Church of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was this prophet in our dispensation. Understanding how God leads His people and establishes His Church through prophets will help students develop a deeper appreciation of the need for a Restoration and a greater ability to teach others about the Restoration.</p>

					<p data-aid="" id="p7">Invite a student to read <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/ot/amos/8.html?verse=11-12#p11">Amos 8:11–12</a> aloud. Ask students to follow along and identify how the word <em>famine</em> is used as a symbol.</p>

							<p data-aid="" id="p10">What evidence have you seen in the world that there has been a famine of “hearing the words of the Lord”? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/ot/amos/8.html?verse=11#p11">Amos 8:11</a>).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p data-aid="" id="p11">Explain that although the prophecy found in <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/ot/amos/8.html?verse=11-12#p11">Amos 8:11–12</a> has likely been fulfilled multiple times throughout history, one important fulfillment is known as the Great Apostasy. You may want to suggest that students write <em>Apostasy, including the Great Apostasy</em> in the margin of their scriptures next to <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/ot/amos/8.html?verse=11-12#p11">Amos 8:11–12</a>.</p>
					<p data-aid="" id="p12">Display the following statement, and invite a student to read it aloud. Ask students to look for some of the factors that contributed to the Great Apostasy.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p data-aid="" id="p13">“After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept the doctrines of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the doctrines were corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li>
							<p data-aid="" id="p15">According to this statement, what were some factors that contributed to the Great Apostasy?</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p data-aid="" id="p16">Why is it essential to understand that the Great Apostasy actually occurred? (Students may use different words, but make sure they identify the following principle: <strong>Knowing that there was a Great Apostasy can help us recognize the need for the Restoration of the gospel.</strong>)</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p data-aid="" id="p18">Display the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910–2008), and invite a student to read it aloud:</p>

					<p data-aid="" id="p20">Remind students that in 1820 the young boy Joseph Smith was searching for the true Church but could not find it. Invite students to read <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.html?verse=5-10#p5">Joseph Smith—History 1:5–10</a> silently, looking for phrases that describe challenges caused by the Great Apostasy.</p>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li>
							<p data-aid="" id="p21">What are some of the phrases Joseph Smith used to refer to the spiritual challenges of his day?</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p data-aid="" id="p22">How did Joseph describe his feelings that came as a result of the religious turmoil that surrounded him?</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p data-aid="" id="p23">Remind students that Joseph Smith’s search for truth resulted in the First Vision and his call as a prophet. (These will be discussed in the next lesson.) Point out that the calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration of the gospel followed a pattern established by God that has been repeated throughout history. For example, the calling of Enoch (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/pgp/moses/6.html?verse=26-32#p26">Moses 6:26–32</a>) and of Noah (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="../../scriptures/pgp/moses/8.html?verse=17-20#p17">Moses 8:17–20</a>) followed this pattern. Display the following explanation of this pattern, and invite a student read it aloud:</p>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li>
							<p data-aid="" id="p25">How does the Restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith follow a pattern seen in earlier dispensations? (Students may use different words, but make sure they identify the following doctrine: <strong>After periods of general apostasy, God calls prophets and gives them authority to restore and teach the gospel anew.</strong> Students should also understand this doctrine: <strong>Joseph Smith was called by God to restore the gospel for our dispensation.</strong>)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p data-aid="" id="p26">How might understanding this pattern help you explain the Restoration of the gospel to someone of another faith?</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p data-aid="" id="p27">Emphasize that in the First Vision, Joseph Smith learned that no true Church existed upon the earth and that the fulness of Christ’s gospel needed to be restored. Although the Bible contains prophecies of the Great Apostasy, the most important evidence that this apostasy occurred is the fact that Joseph Smith was called to be a prophet and the fulness of the gospel was restored.</p>

You may want to suggest that students mark words and phrases that describe these spiritual conditions.

					<p data-aid="128327156" id="p53">Just as Jesus Christ led His Apostles through revelation after His Resurrection, He continues to direct the Church today through living prophets and apostles.
